      "text": "What To Say When You Talk To Yourself\nShad Helmstetter\n\tOn programming your brain\n\t\tWhen I was quite young I had a soaring imagination.\nLong before I learned what we could not do, I\ndreamed of doing what I knew we could. \nI could reach out and touch those stars. I\ncould imagine any dream and see it come true.\n\t\tIt makes no difference whether\nwe believe it or not. The brain simply believes what\nyou tell it most. And what you tell it about you, it will\ncreate. It has no choice.\n\t\tSince the old programming controls the habits, it is\nthe old habits which once again take over.\n\t\tOf all the self-help concepts I have uncovered, the\nconcept of \"programming\" the brain with a more\nsuccessful \"new picture\" of yourself is the most sensible.\n\t\tWe Learn to Believe\n\t\t\tWhat adults tell us as children has an incredibly\nimportant effect on us. It forms what we believe about\nmost of what is going on around us and almost everything\nthat we come to believe about ourselves.\n\t\t\tSome of our programming is obvious. It stands up, gets our attention and demands our response. But much of our programming is not nearly so apparent. Most of it has been much more subtle.\n\nEvery day each of us receives an endless stream of commands, directives, controls, inducements, and expectations from others. Everything around us nudges, demands, or persuades.\n\t\t\tMuch of the programming which each of us received was the wrong kind; that as much as seventy-five percent or more of everything that is recorded and stored in our subconscious minds is counterproductive and works against us-in short, we are programmed not to succeed!\n\t\t\tYou can reprogram. You can erase the old negative,\ncounter-productive, work-against-you programming\nand replace it with a healthy, new, positive, productive\nkind of programming. And it's easy. Erase and replace.\nAll you have to do is learn how to talk to\nyourself.\n\t\t\tThe Missing Ingredients from many self-help and business books\n\t\t\t\t1) The first missing ingredient is permanence. All\n\"external\" solutions are temporary. Even the best of\nthe ideas work only for a time. Without constant\nattention and effort, even the most exciting success\nbreakthroughs run their course and eventually end up\non our list of \"good ideas\" and \"good intentions.\n\t\t\t\t2) The second ingredient missing from most of the\nsuccess literature is a knowledge of the physiological\nprocesses of the human brain-based on what we now\nknow about actual mind/brain functions. Without an\nunderstanding of the actual process by which the\nhuman brain accepts information (programming) and,\nin turn, responds, directs and controls us, it would be\ndifficult (or impossible) to create any success plan that\nworked and kept working indefinitely.\n\t\t\t\t3) The third missing ingredient, and the most important\nof all, is a new, word-for-word set of directions, new programming to the subconscious mind\n(the control center of the brain). That means a specific \"programming vocabulary\" which is worded in a specific way, that anyone can use at any time, to erase and replace the old negative programming with positive, productive new directions.\n\tHow To Program your brain with self-talk\n\t\tAll external motivation is temporary. External motivation is the kind that may wake you up, but it will not keep you awake for long. External motivation is motivation which comes to you from the outside. It may influence you to make a change, but it cannot make the change for you.\n\t\tHow about being your own motivator? How about taking charge and putting yourself back in control? You can, just by learning that all true motivation-the only kind that lasts, the only kind you can count on-is internal motivation.\n\nImagine having a coach that stayed with you, season after season and every day in between. Imagine not needing to wait for someone else to get you charged up and moving. Imagine being able to rely on yourself to always automatically and unconsciously energize your spirit, focus your attention, and keep you in tune, on top, in touch, and going for it! Can you imagine never again needing someone else to prod or push you into activating your own best efforts?\n\nYour own internal coach is waiting to do just that.\n\t\t\tThe five steps that control \nour success or failure.\n\t\t\t\t1. Behaviour\n\t\t\t\t\tThe step that most directly controls our success or\nfailure is our behavior-what we do or do not do.\nBehavior means our actions. How we act, what wedo,\neach moment of each day will determine whether or\nnot we will be successful that moment or that day in\nanything that we do.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reason we don't heed even our own advice is\nbecause of something else which affects, directs, influences,\nor controls all of our actions. That something\nthat makes us do what we do is called our feelings.\n\t\t\t\t2. Feelings\n\t\t\t\t\tEvery action we take is first filtered through our feelings. How we feel about something will always determine or affect what we do and how well we do it.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut what causes you to have the feelings which are\nso much a part of you? Did you get them by accident?\nWhat creates the way you feel about anything?\nChance? Never. Your feelings are created, controlled,\ndetermined, or influenced by your attitudes\n\t\t\t\t3. Attitudes\n\t\t\t\t\tYour attitudes are the perspectives from which you\nview life. Some people seem to have a good attitude\nabout most things. Some people seem to have a bad\nattitude about everything. But when you look closer,\nyou will find that most of us have a combination of\nattitudes, some good, some not so good.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut where do we get our attitudes? Are we born\nwith them? Or do they just appear out of nowhere?\nOur attitudes are no accident. They don't just happen.\nOur attitudes are created, controlled, or influenced\nentirely by our beliefs.\n\t\t\t\t4. Beliefs\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat we believe about anything will determine our\nattitudes about it, create our feelings, direct our\nactions, and in each instance, help us to do well or\npoorly, succeed or fail. The belief that we have about\nanything is so powerful that it can even make something\nappear to be something different than what it\nreally is! \"Belief\" does not require that something be\nthe way we see it to be. It only requires us to believethat it is.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat makes us believe? Do our beliefs just one day spring out of nowhere? Were our beliefs handed to us on the day of our births, like birthmarks of our heredities\nto be kept forever? Do we create them ourselves?\n Our beliefs are not accidents\nof nature. Our beliefs are created and directed entirely\nby our programming\n\t\t\t\t5. Programming\n\t\t\t\t\tWe believe what we are programmed to believe.\nOur conditioning, from the day we were born, has\ncreated, reinforced, and nearly permanently cemented\nmost of what we believe about ourselves and what we\nbelieve about most of what goes on around us.\nWhether the programming was right or wrong, true or\nfalse, the result of it is what we believe.\n\t\t\tSelf-Talk\n\t\t\t\tWhat is self-talk\n\t\t\t\t\tMost of our self-talk is unconscious; we are not even aware of it. \nAt times our self-talk comes in feelings that can't quite be put into words. At other times it\ncomes in little flashes, flickers of thoughts which never\nquite catch fire or glow bright enough or last long\nenough to become ideas, clearly thought out and understood.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf everything you tell yourself about yourself becomes a directive to your subconscious mind, then any\ntime you make a statement about yourself that is negative you are directing your subconscious mind to make you become the person you just described negatively!\n\t\t\t\t\tThe subconscious mind does not see the difference\nbetween the statement that we are clumsy and the\nstatement that we are graceful, well-coordinated, and\nin control. It does not know the difference between\nbeing told that we are poor, and the statement that we\nare wealthy. It accepts our programming just as we\ngive it.\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause we learned our programs from people\naround us, it is natural that we also pass the same kind\nof programming on to others. Unless we learn differently,\nwe end up giving the same programming to our\nown children. I have collected dozens of examples of\nstatements and comments which loving parents have\ntold their children without once realizing that they\nwere creating a self-belief in that child that would\ncreate failure instead of the happiness and success\nthey were trying to bestow.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe have learned that what we put into our brains is\nwhat we will get back out. We also have learned that\nthe subconscious mind will believe\nanything you tell it. It will even believe a lie. If you\ntell it often enough and strongly enough. The brain\nmakes no moral judgments, it simply accepts what you\ntell it.\n\t\t\t\tThe Five Levels of Self-Talk\n\t\t\t\t\tLevel 1\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLevel 1 self-talk represents everything from our\nsimplest misgivings to the worst fears we have about\nourselves. It is our way of telling ourselves to hesitate,\nquestion our capabilities, and accept less than we\nknow we could have done, had we only given ourselves\na chance.\n\t\t\t\t\tLevel 2\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLevel 2 self-talk is characterized by words such as,\n\"I need to. . .,\" or \"I ought to. . .,\" or \"I should. . . .\"\nWhy does that work against us? Because it recognizes\na problem, but creates no solution.\n\t\t\t\t\tLevel 3\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLevel 3 Self-Talk is the first level of Self-Talk that\nworks for you instead of against you. In this level you\nrecognize the need to change, but also you make the\ndecision to do something about it--and you state the\ndecision in the \"present tenst\" though the change\nhas' already taken place.\nLevel 3 is characterized by the words, \"I never . . .,\" or \"I no longer.\" \nIn this level you say, \"I never smoke!\" \"I no longer have a problem dealing with\npeople at work.\" \"I never eat more than I should.\" \"I\nnever get upset in traffic.\" \"I no longer put off doing\nanything I want to get done.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tLevel 4\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLevel 4 Self-Talk is characterized by the words, \"I\nam...\" \"I am organized and in control of my life. I\nam a winner! I am healthy, energetic, enthusiastic, and\nI'm going for it! Nothing can stop me now. I like who I\nam. I am in tune, on top, and in touch. I have determination,\ndrive, and self-belief.\n\t\t\t\t\tLevel 5\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis level of Self-Talk has been spoken for thousands\nof years. It is as old as the ancient religions\nwhich inspired it. It is the Self-Talk of \"oneness\" with\nGod. This level of Self-Talk speaks of a unity of spirit,\na divine and timeless cosmic affinity which transcends\nall worldly things and gives meaning to our being.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is still important, however, that we take care\ntoday of the things that are required today. So 1 urge\nyou to begin to use the Self-Talk of Level 3 and Level\n4. If it's right, Level 5 will come in due time. For\nnow, learn the Self-Talk that will get you to work on\ntime, help you fix your family ties, give yourself the\nself-image you deserve, and get the basic things in this\nlife in order.\n\t\t\t\tHow to implement self-talk\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are five different methods for using Self-Talk;\nyou may choose to use some or all of them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSilent Self-Talk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is the Self-Talk that goes on all of the time,\nalthough we are usually not aware of it. Silent Self-\nTalk can be either a conscious or an unconscious\ninternal dialogue. When you begin to replace old self talk\nwith positive new Self-Talk, this is one of the\neasiest and most natural techniques to use.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSelf-speak\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnything you say out loud to yourself, or to someone\nelse about yourself, or about anything else, is part\nof your self-talk. What you say when you are speaking\nmakes up an important part of the pictures and directions\nyou are feeding to your subconscious mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSelf-Conversation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis form of Self-Talk is one of the easiest to use,\nand it can also be a lot of fun. Self-conversation is the\ntechnique of actually talking to yourself out loud and\nholding down both ends of the conversation all by\nyourself! Self-conversation is one of the most effective\nforms of Self-Talk because it engages more of your\nsenses and puts more of you to work programming\nyourself in the new way. When you have a self conversation,\nmore of you gets involved!\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSelf-Write\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSelf-write is the kind of Self-Talk that you write out,\nword for word, for yourself. It is Self-Talk that is\nphrased in specific Self-Talk statements which deal\ndirectly with the most important new instructions you\nwant to deliver to your subconscious mind-the new\nprogramming you want to work on most.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTape-Talk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach morning I read the cards, one by one, and I\nbegan to notice their effect. They were starting to\nwork. Slowly but surely I was beginning to believe\nwhat the cards were telling me.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe better way is to record self-talk and play it to yourself over and over again.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe self-talk check list\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Is your self-talk stated in the present tense?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2. is it specific?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Does it get the job done without creating any unwanted side effects?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlways add Self-Talk which directs you to achieve\nyour objectives in a healthy and beneficial way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMake sure the words you give yourself tell your subconscious\nmind to get the job done in a way that is\nhealthy and beneficial for all concerned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Is it easy to use?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt should be easy to recall and use any time you need it. If it isn't, you\nwon't use it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5. is it practical?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can even go beyond what you once thought you\ncould attain-and you should! But don't start demanding\nmiracles of yourself until you have learned how to\nfix some of the everyday problems and reach some\nreadily attainable goals. If you get really good, there\nwill be time enough for miracles later.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Is it personal and is it honest?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe only way to stop yourself from reliving the\nroadblocks that have stopped you in the past is to be\nhonest about them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7. Does your self-talk ask enough of you?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJust as it is important for each of us to keep our feet\non the ground, it is important to expect from ourselves\nthe best that we have to offer.",

      "originalText": "What To Say When You Talk To Yourself\nShad Helmstetter\n\tOn programming your brain\n\t\tWhen I was quite young I had a soaring imagination.\nLong before I learned what we could not do, I\ndreamed of doing what I knew we could. \nI could reach out and touch those stars. I\ncould imagine any dream and see it come true.\n\t\tIt makes no difference whether\nwe believe it or not. The brain simply believes what\nyou tell it most. And what you tell it about you, it will\ncreate. It has no choice.\n\t\tSince the old programming controls the habits, it is\nthe old habits which once again take over.\n\t\tOf all the self-help concepts I have uncovered, the\nconcept of \"programming\" the brain with a more\nsuccessful \"new picture\" of yourself is the most sensible.\n\t\tWe Learn to Believe\n\t\t\tWhat adults tell us as children has an incredibly\nimportant effect on us. It forms what we believe about\nmost of what is going on around us and almost everything\nthat we come to believe about ourselves.\n\t\t\tSome of our programming is obvious. It stands up, gets our attention and demands our response. But much of our programming is not nearly so apparent. Most of it has been much more subtle.\n\nEvery day each of us receives an endless stream of commands, directives, controls, inducements, and expectations from others. Everything around us nudges, demands, or persuades.\n\t\t\tMuch of the programming which each of us received was the wrong kind; that as much as seventy-five percent or more of everything that is recorded and stored in our subconscious minds is counterproductive and works against us-in short, we are programmed not to succeed!\n\t\t\tYou can reprogram. You can erase the old negative,\ncounter-productive, work-against-you programming\nand replace it with a healthy, new, positive, productive\nkind of programming. And it's easy. Erase and replace.\nAll you have to do is learn how to talk to\nyourself.\n\t\t\tThe Missing Ingredients from many self-help and business books\n\t\t\t\t1) The first missing ingredient is permanence. All\n\"external\" solutions are temporary. Even the best of\nthe ideas work only for a time. Without constant\nattention and effort, even the most exciting success\nbreakthroughs run their course and eventually end up\non our list of \"good ideas\" and \"good intentions.\n\t\t\t\t2) The second ingredient missing from most of the\nsuccess literature is a knowledge of the physiological\nprocesses of the human brain-based on what we now\nknow about actual mind/brain functions. Without an\nunderstanding of the actual process by which the\nhuman brain accepts information (programming) and,\nin turn, responds, directs and controls us, it would be\ndifficult (or impossible) to create any success plan that\nworked and kept working indefinitely.\n\t\t\t\t3) The third missing ingredient, and the most important\nof all, is a new, word-for-word set of directions, new programming to the subconscious mind\n(the control center of the brain). That means a specific \"programming vocabulary\" which is worded in a specific way, that anyone can use at any time, to erase and replace the old negative programming with positive, productive new directions.\n\tHow To Program your brain with self-talk\n\t\tAll external motivation is temporary. External motivation is the kind that may wake you up, but it will not keep you awake for long. External motivation is motivation which comes to you from the outside. It may influence you to make a change, but it cannot make the change for you.\n\t\tHow about being your own motivator? How about taking charge and putting yourself back in control? You can, just by learning that all true motivation-the only kind that lasts, the only kind you can count on-is internal motivation.\n\nImagine having a coach that stayed with you, season after season and every day in between. Imagine not needing to wait for someone else to get you charged up and moving. Imagine being able to rely on yourself to always automatically and unconsciously energize your spirit, focus your attention, and keep you in tune, on top, in touch, and going for it! Can you imagine never again needing someone else to prod or push you into activating your own best efforts?\n\nYour own internal coach is waiting to do just that.\n\t\t\tThe five steps that control \nour success or failure.\n\t\t\t\t1. Behaviour\n\t\t\t\t\tThe step that most directly controls our success or\nfailure is our behavior-what we do or do not do.\nBehavior means our actions. How we act, what wedo,\neach moment of each day will determine whether or\nnot we will be successful that moment or that day in\nanything that we do.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reason we don't heed even our own advice is\nbecause of something else which affects, directs, influences,\nor controls all of our actions. That something\nthat makes us do what we do is called our feelings.\n\t\t\t\t2. Feelings\n\t\t\t\t\tEvery action we take is first filtered through our feelings. How we feel about something will always determine or affect what we do and how well we do it.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut what causes you to have the feelings which are\nso much a part of you? Did you get them by accident?\nWhat creates the way you feel about anything?\nChance? Never. Your feelings are created, controlled,\ndetermined, or influenced by your attitudes\n\t\t\t\t3. Attitudes\n\t\t\t\t\tYour attitudes are the perspectives from which you\nview life. Some people seem to have a good attitude\nabout most things. Some people seem to have a bad\nattitude about everything. But when you look closer,\nyou will find that most of us have a combination of\nattitudes, some good, some not so good.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut where do we get our attitudes? Are we born\nwith them? Or do they just appear out of nowhere?\nOur attitudes are no accident. They don't just happen.\nOur attitudes are created, controlled, or influenced\nentirely by our beliefs.\n\t\t\t\t4.

Wherever you can stand in this world mentally that you can realize.\r\n\t\t\t\tHe said, \"Neville, it took me almost three years to really overcome that fixed idea that I, by the accident of birth, would be a secondary citizen, but I overcame it. \n\nNow here is my office on Wilshire Boulevard. I picked this one not because it was the only one offered; four equally wonderful spots were offered me. I took this one because it had greater telephone facilities , but the others were equally good. \n\nNow here is my office. Now you couldn't judge my income from this office, lovely as it is. Everything is nice about it, but, Neville, this year I will net a quarter of a million dollars\". Well in America that is still a fabulous sum of money. It would be staggering in any other part of the world, but even in fabulous America a man to net a quarter of a million is really up in the very highest of brackets. \n\nAnd that was the man that a few years ago told me the whole vast world was against him by reason of the accident of birth. He knows now he is what he is by virtue of the state of consciousness with which he is identified, and the choice is his to go back to the restrictions of his childhood when he believed the story or to continue in the freedom that he has found.\r\n\t\t\t\tSo you and I can be anything in this world we desire to be if we will clearly define our aim in life and constantly occupy that aim. It must be habitual. \n\nThe concept we hold of self that is noble must not be put on just for a moment and taken off when we leave this church. \n\nWe feel free here; we feel that we have something in common, that's why we are here, but are we going to wear the noble concept we now hold of self when we go through the door and enter that bus, or are we going to return to the restrictions that were ours prior to coming here? \n\nThe choice is ours and the hardest lesson to learn is that there is no one in this world that can be drawn into your world unless you, and you alone, call him.",

They crave love from none, yet give love to all.\n\n-James Allen, The Heavenly Life\r\n\tFrom last video\r\n\t\tThis is a glorious thought and one worth sitting in the silence with, \"I and my Father are one.\" \n\nYou have heard it for years, yet when you ponder it anew with the thought that from the next thought I am going to think God's thoughts, it will reveal in you a newness of life and purpose you have never known before.\n\nThe \"still small voice\" of which so much has beed said, will finally become the only voice, as you begin to realize your oneness with the Father within.\n\nAt first the din of mortal thinking and living cry loud for an audience. \n\nIt will present evidence and facts by the inner turning, it will finally become so weak that it cannot be heard, then every time you will turn within you will hear only one voice and that will be the \"still small voice\" which will guide you in all Truth, for The Still, Small Voice, guides, points, lights and shows the way you are to go, without confusion or fear.\n\nAbd Allah, Teacher, Healer - Walter Lanyon\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCongruence\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Old Testament in the book of Joshua it is said in these words: \"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.\" Joshua 1:3\n\nIt does not matter where it is; analyze the promise and see if you can accept it literally. \n\nIt is not physically true but it is psychologically true. Wherever you can stand in this world mentally that you can realize.\r\n\t\t\t\tHe said, \"Neville, it took me almost three years to really overcome that fixed idea that I, by the accident of birth, would be a secondary citizen, but I overcame it. \n\nNow here is my office on Wilshire Boulevard. I picked this one not because it was the only one offered; four equally wonderful spots were offered me. I took this one because it had greater telephone facilities , but the others were equally good. \n\nNow here is my office. Now you couldn't judge my income from this office, lovely as it is. Everything is nice about it, but, Neville, this year I will net a quarter of a million dollars\". Well in America that is still a fabulous sum of money. It would be staggering in any other part of the world, but even in fabulous America a man to net a quarter of a million is really up in the very highest of brackets. \n\nAnd that was the man that a few years ago told me the whole vast world was against him by reason of the accident of birth. He knows now he is what he is by virtue of the state of consciousness with which he is identified, and the choice is his to go back to the restrictions of his childhood when he believed the story or to continue in the freedom that he has found.\r\n\t\t\t\tSo you and I can be anything in this world we desire to be if we will clearly define our aim in life and constantly occupy that aim. It must be habitual. \n\nThe concept we hold of self that is noble must not be put on just for a moment and taken off when we leave this church. \n\nWe feel free here; we feel that we have something in common, that's why we are here, but are we going to wear the noble concept we now hold of self when we go through the door and enter that bus, or are we going to return to the restrictions that were ours prior to coming here? \n\nThe choice is ours and the hardest lesson to learn is that there is no one in this world that can be drawn into your world unless you, and you alone, call him."

The Suggestion of Association\n\t\t\t\tIt very easy for us to associate certain things with certain other things, and we will find that when one of the things is recalled it will bring with it its associated impressions.\n\t\t\tIII. The Suggestion of Habit\n\t\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Habit: This form of Suggestion is closely allied to the preceding phase, i. e. Suggestion of Association, in fact, some consider it to be merely a branch of the latter. \n\nBut we feel that there is a decided difference in the operation of the two phases, and accordingly prefer to treat this one as forming a separate and distinct phase. \n\nOf course, all habit is an association with something in the past, but Suggestion of Habit may arise from an original cause of Suggestion of Authority; Suggestion of Association; Suggestion of Repetition; Suggestion of Imitation; or else from an original decision of the intellect resulting from correct reasoning. \n\nThe former act or thought acts as a suggestive “outside influence,” although it belongs to one’s own mentality.\n\t\t\tIV. The Suggestion of Repetition\n\t\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Repetition: This form of Suggestion may seem to be very much akin to the preceding phase, i. e. Suggestion of Habit. \n\nBut there is a marked distinction and difference. Suggestion of Habit has its power imparted to it by the habitual repetition of the act or thought on the part of the individual; while Suggestion of Repetition gains its power by the repetition of a Suggestion from some outside object or person. \n\nIt is the constant dripping of water wearing away the stone. \n\nA Suggestion which passes you without much attention or consideration, when first made, will gain both attention and consideration from you if it be repeated sufficiently often, and in the right manner. \n\t\t\tV. The Suggestion of Imitation\n\t\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Imitation: This form of Suggestion while being in itself a distinct phase of Suggestion, nevertheless has a very close relationship with the several other forms of Suggestion. \n\nIn the acceptance of Suggestion of Authority there is to be found an unconscious imitation of the mental attitude of the person asserting the authority; in Suggestion of Association there is an imitation of the associated thing; and in Suggestion of Repetition there is to be found evidences of imitation. Examples Are found in schools of philosophies, theories, thought and religion.\n\t\t\tThe Blending\n\t\t\t\tThe phenomena of Suggestion and that of Auto-Suggestion can also blend into each other in subtle degrees. \n\nFor instance, one may receive an impression from outside—an impression which is the effect of a suggestion from outside—and being impressed by it, they may think it over and think and feel about it, so that the idea takes a firm hold upon them. \n\nUp to this point it is Suggestion in its general phase. \n\nBut, then the suggestion is repeated to themselves, both in self-communion and in conversation with others, until an impression is made much deeper than that caused by the original impression. This secondary effect is Auto-Suggestion, of course.\n\t\t\t\tThere is another form of Auto-Suggestion which is overlooked by many of the authorities. \n\nWe refer to cases of involuntary AutoSuggestion—cases in which the person impresses suggestions upon himself without intending to do so.\n\t\t\tAuto-Suggestion\n\t\t\t\tBy “Auto-Suggestion” is meant the application of the principles of Suggestion by one self upon oneself. \n\nIn Auto Suggestion the individual plays the dual role of suggester and suggestee, respectively. \n\nIn all other respects it is precisely the same thing as Suggestion in its general phases. \n\t\t\t\tAutoSuggestion, as the term is generally applied, we voluntarily select and choose the suggestions which we wish to impress us, and we add to their effect by repetition and attention. \n\nBut in both Suggestion and Auto-Suggestion the principle employed is precisely the same.",

      "text": "The Golden Key by Emmet Fox\n(2022 Interpretations)\r\n\tPremise\r\n\t\tI have compressed this essay into a few pages. Had it been possible I would have reduced it to as many lines. \n\nIt is not intended to be an instructional treatise, but a practical recipe for getting out of trouble. \n\nStudy and research are well in their own time and place, but no amount of either will get you out of a concrete difficulty. \n\nNothing but practical work in your own consciousness will do that. The mistake made by many people, when things go wrong, is to skim \nthrough book after book, without getting anywhere. \n\nRead The Golden Key several times. Do exactly what it says, and if you are persistent enough you will overcome any difficulty.\r\n\tLight of Love\r\n\t\tBeginners often get startling results at the first time of trying, for all that is absolutely essential is to have an open mind, and \nsufficient faith to try the experiment. Apart from that, you may hold any views on religion, or none. \n\nAs for the actual method of working, like all fundamental things, it is simplicity itself.

      "originalText": "The Golden Key by Emmet Fox\n(2022 Interpretations)\r\n\tPremise\r\n\t\tI have compressed this essay into a few pages. Had it been possible I would have reduced it to as many lines. \n\nIt is not intended to be an instructional treatise, but a practical recipe for getting out of trouble. \n\nStudy and research are well in their own time and place, but no amount of either will get you out of a concrete difficulty. \n\nNothing but practical work in your own consciousness will do that. The mistake made by many people, when things go wrong, is to skim through book after book, without getting anywhere. \n\nRead The Golden Key several times. Do exactly what it says, and if you are persistent enough you will overcome any difficulty.\r\n\tLight of Love\r\n\t\tBeginners often get startling results at the first time of trying, for all that is absolutely essential is to have an open mind, and sufficient faith to try the experiment. Apart from that, you may hold any views on religion, or none. \n\nAs for the actual method of working, like all fundamental things, it is simplicity itself. All that you have to do is this: \n\nStop thinking about the difficulty, whatever it is, and think about God instead. \n\nThis is the complete rule, and if only you will do this, the trouble, whatever it is, will presently disappear. It makes no difference what kind of trouble it is.

      "text": "The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind\n Joseph Murphy\r\n\tYour conscious mind & subconscious mind\r\n\t\tConscious\r\n\t\t\tYour conscious mind is the “watchman at the gate.” Its chief function is to protect your subconscious mind from false impressions.\r\n\t\t\tYou have the power to choose. Choose health and happiness. You can choose to be friendly, or you can choose to be unfriendly. Choose to be cooperative, joyous, friendly, lovable, and the whole world will respond. \nThis is the best way to develop a wonderful personality.\r\n\t\t\tYou are like a captain navigating a ship. He must give the right orders, and likewise, you must give the right orders (thoughts and images) to your subconscious mind, which controls and governs all your \nexperiences.\r\n\t\tSubconscious\r\n\t\t\tWhatever your conscious mind assumes and believes to be true, your subconscious and all the blessings of life. mind will accept and bring to pass. Believe in good fortune, divine guidance, right action.\r\n\t\t\tYour subconscious mind controls all the vital processes of your body and knows the answer to all problems.\r\n\t\t\tThink good, and good follows. Think evil, and evil follows. You are what you think all day long.\r\n\t\t\tWhether the object of your faith is real or false, you will get results. Your subconscious mind responds to the thought in your mind. Look upon faith as a thought in your mind, and that will suffice.\r\n\t\t\tThe infinite intelligence within your subconscious mind can reveal to you everything you\nneed to know at every moment of time and point of space provided you are open-minded\nand receptive.\r\n\tProgramming Your subconscious mind\r\n\t\tWhatever you impress on your subconscious mind is expressed on the screen of space and thoughts entertained in your conscious mind.\nas conditions, experiences, and events. Therefore, you should carefully watch all ideas\r\n\t\tChange your thoughts, and you change your destiny.\r\n\t\tWatch what you say. You have to account for every idle word. Never say, “I will fail; I will lose my job; I can’t pay the rent.” Your subconscious cannot take a joke. It brings all\nthese things to pass.\r\n\t\tKeep your conscious mind busy with the expectation of the best, and your subconscious will faithfully reproduce your habitual thinking.\r\n\t\tNever say, “I can’t.” Overcome that fear by substituting the following, “I can do all things through the power of my own subconscious mind.”\r\n\t\tYour subconscious has the answer to all problems. If you suggest to your subconscious prior to sleep, “I want to get up at 6 A.M.,” it will awaken you at that exact time.\r\n\t\tIf you want to write a book, write a wonderful play, give a better talk to your audience, convey the idea lovingly and feelingly to your subconscious mind, and it will respond accordingly.\r\n\t\tNever use the terms, “I can’t afford it” or “I can’t do this.” Your subconscious mind takes you at your word and sees to it that you do not have the money or the ability to do what you want to do. Affirm, \n“I can do all things through the power of my subconscious mind.”\r\n\t\tImagine the happy ending or solution to your problem, feel the thrill of accomplishment, and what you imagine and feel will be accepted by your subconscious\nmind and bring it to pass.\r\n\t\tRemind yourself frequently that the healing power is in your own subconscious mind.\r\n\t\tDevelop a definite plan for turning over your requests or desires to your subconscious mind.\r\n\t\tImagine the end desired and feel its reality. Follow it through, and you will get definite results.\r\n\t\tFeel the joy and restfulness in foreseeing the certain accomplishment of your desire. Any mental picture, which you have in your mind, is the substance of things hoped for\nand the evidence of things not seen.\r\n\t\tA mental picture is worth a thousand words. Your subconscious will bring to pass any picture held in the mind backed by faith.\r\n\t\tRemember that the thankful heart is always close to the riches of the universe.\r\n\t\tMental coercion or too much effort shows anxiety and fear, which block your answer. Easy does it.\r\n\t\tWhen your mind is relaxed and you accept an idea, your subconscious goes to work to execute the idea.\r\n\t\tThink and plan independently of traditional methods. Know that there is always an answer and a solution to every problem.\r\n\t\tImagination is your most powerful faculty. Imagine what is lovely and of good report. You are what you imagine yourself to be.\r\n\tWealth\r\n\t\tDecide to be wealthy the easy way, with the infallible aid of your subconscious mind.\r\n\t\tThe feeling of wealth produces wealth. Keep this in mind at all times.\r\n\t\tYour conscious and subconscious mind must agree. Your subconscious accepts what you really feel to be true. The dominant idea is always accepted by your subconscious dominant idea should be wealth, not \npoverty.\r\n\t\tWhat you consciously affirm, you must not mentally deny a few moments later. This will neutralize the good you have affirmed.\r\n\t\tYour true source of wealth consists of the ideas in your mind. You can have an idea worth millions of dollars. Your subconscious will give you the idea you seek.\r\n\t\tEnvy and jealousy are stumbling blocks to the flow of wealth. Rejoice in the prosperity of others.\r\n\t\tThe block to wealth is in your own mind. Destroy that block now by getting on good mental terms with everyone.\r\n\t\tStop trying to get something for nothing. There is no such thing as a free lunch. You must give to receive. You must give mental attention to your goals, ideals, and enterprises, and your deeper mind will back you \nup. The key to wealth is application of the laws of the subconscious mind by impregnating it with the idea of wealth.\r\n\t\tOne reason many people simply make ends meet and never have enough money is that they condemn money. What you condemn takes wings and flies away.\r\n\tHappiness\r\n\t\tGive thanks for all your blessings several times a day. Furthermore, pray for the peace, happiness, and prosperity of all members of your family, your associates, and all people\neverywhere.\r\n\t\tYou must sincerely desire to be happy. Nothing is accomplished without desire. Desire is a wish with wings of imagination and faith. Imagine the fulfillment of your desire, and\nfeel its reality, and it will come to pass. Happiness comes in answered prayer.\r\n\t\tThere is no block to your happiness. External things are not causative; these are effects, not cause. Take your cue from the only creative principle within you. Your\nthought is cause, and a new cause produces a new effect. Choose happiness.\r\n\tDealing with others\r\n\t\tYou attract the right mate by dwelling on the qualities and characteristics you admire in a woman or a man, and then your subconscious mind will bring you together in divine\norder.\r\n\t\tDo not wonder how, why, or where you will meet the mate you are praying for. Trust implicitly the wisdom of your subconscious mind. It has the “knowhow,” and you don’t\nhave to assist it.\r\n\t\tYour subconscious mind is a recording machine, which reproduces your habitual thinking. Think good of the other, and you are actually thinking good about yourself.\r\n\t\tA hateful or resentful thought is a mental poison. Do not think ill of another for to do so is to think ill of yourself. You are the only thinker in your universe, and your thoughts are creative.\r\n\t\tTo cheat, rob, or defraud another brings lack, loss, and limitation to yourself. Your subconscious mind records your inner motivations, thoughts, and feelings. These being of\na negative nature; loss, limitation, and trouble come to you in countless ways. Actually,\nwhat you do to the other, you are doing to yourself.\r\n\t\tYou are the only thinker in your world. You are responsible for the way you think about the other. Remember, the other person is not responsible for the way you think\nabout him. Your thoughts are reproduced. What are you thinking now about the other\nfellow?\r\n\t\tBecome emotionally mature and permit other people to differ from you. They have a perfect right to disagree with you, and you have the same freedom to disagree with them.\nYou can disagree without being disagreeable.\r\n\t\tYour inner speech, representing your silent thoughts and feelings, is experienced in the reactions of others toward you.\r\n\t\tRadiate love, peace, and good will to each other. These vibrations are picked up by the subconscious mind resulting in mutual trust, affection, and respect.\r\n\t\tNever yield to emotional scenes and tantrums of others. Appeasement never wins. Do not be a doormat. Adhere to that which is right. Stick to your ideal, knowing that the\nmental outlook, which gives you peace, happiness, and joy, is right, good, and true. What\nblesses you, blesses all.\r\n\t\tYou cannot be hurt by criticism when you know that you are master of your thoughts, reactions, and emotions. This gives you the opportunity to pray and bless the other,\nthereby blessing yourself.\r\n\tMental Blocks\r\n\t\tThe solution lies within the problem. The answer is in every question. Infinite intelligence responds to you as you call upon it with faith and confidence.\r\n\t\tHabit is the function of your subconscious mind. There is no greater evidence of the marvelous power of your subconscious than the force and sway habit holds in your life.\nYou are a creature of habit.\r\n\t\tYou form habit patterns in your subconscious mind by repeating a thought and act over and over again until it establishes tracks in the subconscious mind and becomes\nautomatic, such as swimming, dancing, typing, walking, driving your car, etc.\r\n\t\tWhatever mental picture, backed by faith, you behold in your conscious mind, and your subconscious mind will bring to pass.\r\n\t\tThe only obstacle to your success and achievement is your own thought or mental image.\r\n\t\tWhen your attention wanders, bring it back to the contemplation of your good or goal. Make a habit of this. This is called disciplining the mind.\r\n\t\tYour conscious mind is the camera, and your subconscious mind is the sensitive plate on which you register or impress the picture.\r\n\tFear\r\n\t\tDo the thing you are afraid to do, and the death of fear is certain. Say to yourself and\nmean it, “I am going to master this fear,” and you will\r\n\t\tIf you are afraid of closed places, such as elevators, lecture halls, etc., mentally ride in an elevator blessing all its parts and functions. You will be amazed how quickly the fear\nwill be dissipated.\r\n\t\tNothing can disturb you but your own thought. The suggestions, statements, or threats of other persons have no power. The power is within you, and when your thoughts\nare focused on that which is good, then God’s power is with your thoughts of good. There\nis only one Creative Power, and It moves as harmony. There are no divisions of quarrels\nin it. Its source is Love. This is why God’s power is with your thoughts of good.\r\n\tYouthfulness\r\n\t\tWelcome the advancing years. It means you are moving higher on the path of life, which has no end.\r\n\t\tYou are as young as you think you are. You are as strong as you think you are. You are as useful as you think you are. You are as young as your thoughts.",

Believe in good fortune, divine guidance, right action.\r\n\t\t\tYour subconscious mind controls all the vital processes of your body and knows the answer to all problems.\r\n\t\t\tThink good, and good follows. Think evil, and evil follows. You are what you think all day long.\r\n\t\t\tWhether the object of your faith is real or false, you will get results. Your subconscious mind responds to the thought in your mind. Look upon faith as a thought in your mind, and that will suffice.\r\n\t\t\tThe infinite intelligence within your subconscious mind can reveal to you everything you\nneed to know at every moment of time and point of space provided you are open-minded\nand receptive.\r\n\tProgramming Your subconscious mind\r\n\t\tWhatever you impress on your subconscious mind is expressed on the screen of space and thoughts entertained in your conscious mind.\nas conditions, experiences, and events. Therefore, you should carefully watch all ideas\r\n\t\tChange your thoughts, and you change your destiny.\r\n\t\tWatch what you say. You have to account for every idle word. Never say, “I will fail; I will lose my job; I can’t pay the rent.” Your subconscious cannot take a joke. It brings all\nthese things to pass.\r\n\t\tKeep your conscious mind busy with the expectation of the best, and your subconscious will faithfully reproduce your habitual thinking.\r\n\t\tNever say, “I can’t.” Overcome that fear by substituting the following, “I can do all things through the power of my own subconscious mind.”\r\n\t\tYour subconscious has the answer to all problems. If you suggest to your subconscious prior to sleep, “I want to get up at 6 A.M.,” it will awaken you at that exact time.\r\n\t\tIf you want to write a book, write a wonderful play, give a better talk to your audience, convey the idea lovingly and feelingly to your subconscious mind, and it will respond accordingly.\r\n\t\tNever use the terms, “I can’t afford it” or “I can’t do this.” Your subconscious mind takes you at your word and sees to it that you do not have the money or the ability to do what you want to do. Affirm, “I can do all things through the power of my subconscious mind.”\r\n\t\tImagine the happy ending or solution to your problem, feel the thrill of accomplishment, and what you imagine and feel will be accepted by your subconscious\nmind and bring it to pass.\r\n\t\tRemind yourself frequently that the healing power is in your own subconscious mind.\r\n\t\tDevelop a definite plan for turning over your requests or desires to your subconscious mind.\r\n\t\tImagine the end desired and feel its reality. Follow it through, and you will get definite results.\r\n\t\tFeel the joy and restfulness in foreseeing the certain accomplishment of your desire. Any mental picture, which you have in your mind, is the substance of things hoped for\nand the evidence of things not seen.\r\n\t\tA mental picture is worth a thousand words. Your subconscious will bring to pass any picture held in the mind backed by faith.\r\n\t\tRemember that the thankful heart is always close to the riches of the universe.\r\n\t\tMental coercion or too much effort shows anxiety and fear, which block your answer. Easy does it.\r\n\t\tWhen your mind is relaxed and you accept an idea, your subconscious goes to work to execute the idea.\r\n\t\tThink and plan independently of traditional methods. Know that there is always an answer and a solution to every problem.\r\n\t\tImagination is your most powerful faculty. Imagine what is lovely and of good report. You are what you imagine yourself to be.\r\n\tWealth\r\n\t\tDecide to be wealthy the easy way, with the infallible aid of your subconscious mind.\r\n\t\tThe feeling of wealth produces wealth. Keep this in mind at all times.\r\n\t\tYour conscious and subconscious mind must agree. Your subconscious accepts what you really feel to be true. The dominant idea is always accepted by your subconscious dominant idea should be wealth, not poverty.\r\n\t\tWhat you consciously affirm, you must not mentally deny a few moments later. This will neutralize the good you have affirmed.\r\n\t\tYour true source of wealth consists of the ideas in your mind. You can have an idea worth millions of dollars. Your subconscious will give you the idea you seek.\r\n\t\tEnvy and jealousy are stumbling blocks to the flow of wealth. Rejoice in the prosperity of others.\r\n\t\tThe block to wealth is in your own mind. Destroy that block now by getting on good mental terms with everyone.\r\n\t\tStop trying to get something for nothing. There is no such thing as a free lunch. You must give to receive. You must give mental attention to your goals, ideals, and enterprises, and your deeper mind will back you up. The key to wealth is application of the laws of the subconscious mind by impregnating it with the idea of wealth.\r\n\t\tOne reason many people simply make ends meet and never have enough money is that they condemn money. What you condemn takes wings and flies away.\r\n\tHappiness\r\n\t\tGive thanks for all your blessings several times a day. Furthermore, pray for the peace, happiness, and prosperity of all members of your family, your associates, and all people\neverywhere.\r\n\t\tYou must sincerely desire to be happy. Nothing is accomplished without desire. Desire is a wish with wings of imagination and faith. Imagine the fulfillment of your desire, and\nfeel its reality, and it will come to pass. Happiness comes in answered prayer.\r\n\t\tThere is no block to your happiness. External things are not causative; these are effects, not cause. Take your cue from the only creative principle within you. Your\nthought is cause, and a new cause produces a new effect. Choose happiness.\r\n\tDealing with others\r\n\t\tYou attract the right mate by dwelling on the qualities and characteristics you admire in a woman or a man, and then your subconscious mind will bring you together in divine\norder.\r\n\t\tDo not wonder how, why, or where you will meet the mate you are praying for. Trust implicitly the wisdom of your subconscious mind. It has the “knowhow,” and you don’t\nhave to assist it.\r\n\t\tYour subconscious mind is a recording machine, which reproduces your habitual thinking. Think good of the other, and you are actually thinking good about yourself.\r\n\t\tA hateful or resentful thought is a mental poison. Do not think ill of another for to do so is to think ill of yourself. You are the only thinker in your universe, and your thoughts are creative.\r\n\t\tTo cheat, rob, or defraud another brings lack, loss, and limitation to yourself. Your subconscious mind records your inner motivations, thoughts, and feelings. These being of\na negative nature; loss, limitation, and trouble come to you in countless ways. Actually,\nwhat you do to the other, you are doing to yourself.\r\n\t\tYou are the only thinker in your world. You are responsible for the way you think about the other. Remember, the other person is not responsible for the way you think\nabout him. Your thoughts are reproduced. What are you thinking now about the other\nfellow?\r\n\t\tBecome emotionally mature and permit other people to differ from you. They have a perfect right to disagree with you, and you have the same freedom to disagree with them.\nYou can disagree without being disagreeable.\r\n\t\tYour inner speech, representing your silent thoughts and feelings, is experienced in the reactions of others toward you.\r\n\t\tRadiate love, peace, and good will to each other. These vibrations are picked up by the subconscious mind resulting in mutual trust, affection, and respect.\r\n\t\tNever yield to emotional scenes and tantrums of others. Appeasement never wins. Do not be a doormat. Adhere to that which is right. Stick to your ideal, knowing that the\nmental outlook, which gives you peace, happiness, and joy, is right, good, and true. What\nblesses you, blesses all.\r\n\t\tYou cannot be hurt by criticism when you know that you are master of your thoughts, reactions, and emotions. This gives you the opportunity to pray and bless the other,\nthereby blessing yourself.\r\n\tMental Blocks\r\n\t\tThe solution lies within the problem. The answer is in every question. Infinite intelligence responds to you as you call upon it with faith and confidence.\r\n\t\tHabit is the function of your subconscious mind. There is no greater evidence of the marvelous power of your subconscious than the force and sway habit holds in your life.\nYou are a creature of habit.\r\n\t\tYou form habit patterns in your subconscious mind by repeating a thought and act over and over again until it establishes tracks in the subconscious mind and becomes\nautomatic, such as swimming, dancing, typing, walking, driving your car, etc.\r\n\t\tWhatever mental picture, backed by faith, you behold in your conscious mind, and your subconscious mind will bring to pass.\r\n\t\tThe only obstacle to your success and achievement is your own thought or mental image.\r\n\t\tWhen your attention wanders, bring it back to the contemplation of your good or goal. Make a habit of this. This is called disciplining the mind.\r\n\t\tYour conscious mind is the camera, and your subconscious mind is the sensitive plate on which you register or impress the picture.\r\n\tFear\r\n\t\tDo the thing you are afraid to do, and the death of fear is certain. Say to yourself and\nmean it, “I am going to master this fear,” and you will\r\n\t\tIf you are afraid of closed places, such as elevators, lecture halls, etc., mentally ride in an elevator blessing all its parts and functions. You will be amazed how quickly the fear\nwill be dissipated.\r\n\t\tNothing can disturb you but your own thought. The suggestions, statements, or threats of other persons have no power. The power is within you, and when your thoughts\nare focused on that which is good, then God’s power is with your thoughts of good. There\nis only one Creative Power, and It moves as harmony. There are no divisions of quarrels\nin it. Its source is Love. This is why God’s power is with your thoughts of good.\r\n\tYouthfulness\r\n\t\tWelcome the advancing years. It means you are moving higher on the path of life, which has no end.\r\n\t\tYou are as young as you think you are. You are as strong as you think you are. You are as useful as you think you are. You are as young as your thoughts."

Start with a Strong and Persistent Desire\r\n\t\t\tThe desire to share, influence and to bring about positive change\r\n\t\t\tThe desire to go against what others may tell you about your ability\r\n\t\t\tThe desire to be able to think for yourself\r\n\t\t\tIf your desire is not strong enough you will not take action or will create unnecessary resistance\r\n\t\t2. Know Thoroughly What You Are\nGoing to Talk About\r\n\t\t\tYou don't  always need the credentials if you know what you are talking about\r\n\t\t\tSome subjects do require credentials or references \r\n\t\t\tA passionate speaker usually resonates more with an audience rather than a knowledgable one\r\n\t\t\tStrategies (Eben Pagan -  Clear communication)\r\n\t\t\t\tKnow what you want to achieve and be willing to experiment till you get it.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe most important communication you have is with yourself\r\n\t\t\t\tThe second most important communication you have is with your audience\r\n\t\t\t\tThe responsibility of the communication belongs to the communicator\r\n\t\t\t\tBe the message you are trying to communicate\r\n\t\t\tSelf-Confidence\nThrough Preparation\r\n\t\t\t\tDoes the preparation of a speech mean the getting\ntogether of some faultless phrases written down or memorized?\nNo. Does it mean the assembling of a few casual\nthoughts that really convey very little to you personally?\nNot at all.\r\n\t\t\t\tAssembling of your thoughts, your\nideas, your convictions, your urges. You have them every day of your\nwaking life. They even swarm through your dreams. Your\nwhole existence has been filled with feelings and experiences.\nThese things are lying deep in your subconscious mind as\nthick as pebbles on the seashore. Preparation means thinking,\nbrooding, recalling, selecting the ones that appeal to\nyou most, polishing them, working them into a pattern, a\nmosaic of your own.\r\n\t\t\t\tYou will find that the sermons you enjoy preaching the\nmost and the ones which actually accomplish the most\ngood in the lives of your people will be those sermons\nwhich you take most largely out of your own interiors.\r\n\t\t\t\tHow to Prepare Your Talk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. What topics ought you to speak on for practice?\nAnything that interests you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Determine your subject in advance, so that you will have\ntime to think it over in odd moments. Think over it for\nseven days; dream over it for seven nights.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. While preparing, study your audience. Think of their\nWants, their Wishes. That is sometimes half the battle.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. The way to develop reserve power is to know far more\nthan you can use, to have a full reservoir of information.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Don't read, and don't attempt to memorize your\ntalk word for word.\r\n\t\t\tHow to Open a Talk\r\n\t\t\t\tArousing curiosity.\r\n\t\t\t\tRelating to a human interest story.\r\n\t\t\t\tBeginning with a specific illustration.\r\n\t\t\t\tUsing an exhibit.\r\n\t\t\t\tAsking a question.\r\n\t\t\t\tOpening with a striking quotation.\r\n\t\t\t\tShowing how the topic affects the vital interest of\nthe audience.\r\n\t\t\t\tStarting with shocking facts.\r\n\t\t\t\tDon't make your opening too formal. Don't let the\nbones show. Make it appear free, casual, inevitable. This\ncan be done by referring to something that has just happened,\nor something that has just been said.\r\n\t\t\tHow to Interest Your Audience\r\n\t\t\t\tOur chief interest is ourselves.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe person who leads others to talk about themselves\nand their interests and listens intently will generally be\nconsidered a good conversationalist, even though he does\nvery little talking.\r\n\t\t\t\tInterest is contagious. The audience is sure to catch\nit if the speaker himself has a bad case of it. But it cannot\nbe won by the mechanical adherence to mere rules.\r\n\t\t\tHow to Close a Talk\r\n\t\t\t\tStop but don't talk about stopping\r\n\t\t\t\tSummarizing, restating, outlining briefly the main\npoints you have covered.\r\n\t\t\t\tAppealing for action.\r\n\t\t\t\tRaising a laugh.\r\n\t\t3. Practice Confidence\r\n\t\t\t\"Fear is begotten of ignorance and uncertainty,\" says\nProfessor Robinson in The Mind in the Making. To put it\nanother way: it is the result of a lack of confidence.\nAnd what causes that? It is the result of not knowing\nwhat you can really do. And not knowing what you can do\nis caused by a lack of experience. When you get a record\nof successful experience behind you, your fears will vanish.\r\n\t\t\tWe have only four contacts with people. We\nare evaluated and classified by four things\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat we do\r\n\t\t\t\tHow we look\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat we say\r\n\t\t\t\tHow we say it\r\n\t\t\tTo develop courage when you are facing an audience, act as if you already had it or act as if was impossible to fail\r\n\t\t\tEvery talk, regardless of whether the speaker realizes\nit or not, has one of four major goals. (Set your Goal)\r\n\t\t\t\t1. To make something clear.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. To impress and convince.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. To get action.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. To entertain.\r\n\t\t\tConcepts (Eben Pagan's Clear Communication)\r\n\t\t\t\tThe meaning of the communication is the response you get\r\n\t\t\t\tWe must always be checking, testing, confirming and aligning\r\n\t\t\t\tprojection\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the emotional state of someone that had achieved this\r\n\t\t\t\tLying is stressful\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStress is the major killer behind most diseases\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA major cause of stress is lying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe biggest type of lie is withholding information which diverts people into not know what is going on\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe more you tell the truth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe more you detect self-deception\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe easier life becomes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe less stress there is\r\n\t\t\tThe Secret of Good Delivery\r\n\t\t\t\t1. There is something besides the mere words in\na talk which counts. It is the flavor with which they are\ndelivered. \"It is not so much what you say as how you\nsay it.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t2. Many speakers ignore their hearers, stare over their\nheads or at the floor. They seem to be delivering a\nsoliloquy. There is no sense of communication, no give and\ntake between the audience and the speaker. That kind of\nattitude would kill a conversation; it also kills a speech.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Good delivery is conversational tone and directness\nenlarged.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Talk to your hearers just as if you expected them to\nstand up in a moment and talk back to you.\r\n\t\t\t\tPut your heart into your talking. Real emotional\nsincerity\r\n\t\t\tPresence and Personality\r\n\t\t\t\tAccording to experiments conducted by the\nCarnegie Institute of Technology, personality has more\nto do with business success than has superior knowledge.\r\n\t\t\t\tDon't speak when you are tired. Rest, recuperate,\nstore up a reserve of energy.\r\n\t\t\t\tDo nothing to dull your energy. It is magnetic. People\ncluster around the energetic speaker like wild geese\naround a field of autumn wheat.\r\n\t\t\t\tSmile. Come before your hearers with an attitude that\nseems to say you are glad to be there.\r\n\t\t\tGeneral pointers\r\n\t\t\t\tStep out briskly and take a deep\nbreath. In fact, breathe deeply for thirty seconds before you\never face your audience. The increased supply of oxygen\nwill build you up and give you courage.\r\n\t\t\t\tStride forth bravely, stop, stand still and act as if you\nloved it.\r\n\t\t\t\tDraw yourself up to your full height, look your audience\nstraight in the eyes, and begin to talk as confidently as if\nevery one of them owed you money.\r\n\t\t\t\tDo not nervously button and unbutton your coat, play\nwith your beads, or fumble with your hands.\r\n\t\t\t\tAs a general rule, it is bad for a speaker to hide behind\nfurniture; but it may give you a little courage the first few\ntimes to stand behind a table or chair and to grip them\ntightly-or hold a coin firmly in the palm of your hand.\r\n\t\t4. Practice! Practice! Practice!\r\n\t\t\tWhat such a man needs is not courage, but nerve control, cool-headedness. This he can get only by actual practice.\r\n\t\t\t\tIt will feel uncomfortable but you must embrace it\r\n\t\t\t\tMost people will not take this much action\r\n\t\t\t\t80% action 20% theory\r\n\t\t\tImproving Your Diction\r\n\t\t\t\tYour diction will be very largely a reflection of the\ncompany you keep.\r\n\t\t\t\tRead with a dictionary by your side. Look up the\nunfamiliar word. Try to find a use for it so that you may\nfix it in your memory.\r\n\t\t\t\tStudy the derivation of the words you use.\r\n\t\t\tConnecting with people, revels to you details about yourself\r\n\t\t\tTake notes on how you can optimize your progress\r\n\t\t\tOptimizations\r\n\t\t\t\tPower\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you clear and specific?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs your eye contact strong but not overbearing?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you energetic?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you being assertive?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking for approval or reading the situation?\r\n\t\t\t\tPresense\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you in the moment?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs your words, body language and voice tonality in alignment?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you focused on who you are speaking with?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs your energy grounded?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you being real or putting on a front?\r\n\t\t\t\tWarmth\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo you have passion for what you are talking about?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you smiling?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs there a sense of feeling and connection with your audience?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs there a sense of compassion in your communication?\r\n\tAction Items\r\n\t\t1. Book time to speak at formal events or host workshops\r\n\t\t2. Start a Youtube channel or an online platform that uses video to communicate\r\n\t\t3. Participate in discussion groups or forums\r\n\t\t4. Speak to at least 5 new people or groups a day in public\r\n\t\t5.

Your\nwhole existence has been filled with feelings and experiences.\nThese things are lying deep in your subconscious mind as\nthick as pebbles on the seashore. Preparation means thinking,\nbrooding, recalling, selecting the ones that appeal to\nyou most, polishing them, working them into a pattern, a\nmosaic of your own.\r\n\t\t\t\tYou will find that the sermons you enjoy preaching the\nmost and the ones which actually accomplish the most\ngood in the lives of your people will be those sermons\nwhich you take most largely out of your own interiors.\r\n\t\t\t\tHow to Prepare Your Talk\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. What topics ought you to speak on for practice?\nAnything that interests you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Determine your subject in advance, so that you will have\ntime to think it over in odd moments. Think over it for\nseven days; dream over it for seven nights.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. While preparing, study your audience. Think of their\nWants, their Wishes. That is sometimes half the battle.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. The way to develop reserve power is to know far more\nthan you can use, to have a full reservoir of information.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Don't read, and don't attempt to memorize your\ntalk word for word.\r\n\t\t\tHow to Open a Talk\r\n\t\t\t\tArousing curiosity.\r\n\t\t\t\tRelating to a human interest story.\r\n\t\t\t\tBeginning with a specific illustration.\r\n\t\t\t\tUsing an exhibit.\r\n\t\t\t\tAsking a question.\r\n\t\t\t\tOpening with a striking quotation.\r\n\t\t\t\tShowing how the topic affects the vital interest of\nthe audience.\r\n\t\t\t\tStarting with shocking facts.\r\n\t\t\t\tDon't make your opening too formal. Don't let the\nbones show. Make it appear free, casual, inevitable. This\ncan be done by referring to something that has just happened,\nor something that has just been said.\r\n\t\t\tHow to Interest Your Audience\r\n\t\t\t\tOur chief interest is ourselves.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe person who leads others to talk about themselves\nand their interests and listens intently will generally be\nconsidered a good conversationalist, even though he does\nvery little talking.\r\n\t\t\t\tInterest is contagious. The audience is sure to catch\nit if the speaker himself has a bad case of it. But it cannot\nbe won by the mechanical adherence to mere rules.\r\n\t\t\tHow to Close a Talk\r\n\t\t\t\tStop but don't talk about stopping\r\n\t\t\t\tSummarizing, restating, outlining briefly the main\npoints you have covered.\r\n\t\t\t\tAppealing for action.\r\n\t\t\t\tRaising a laugh.\r\n\t\t3. Practice Confidence\r\n\t\t\t\"Fear is begotten of ignorance and uncertainty,\" says\nProfessor Robinson in The Mind in the Making. To put it\nanother way: it is the result of a lack of confidence.\nAnd what causes that? It is the result of not knowing\nwhat you can really do. And not knowing what you can do\nis caused by a lack of experience. When you get a record\nof successful experience behind you, your fears will vanish.\r\n\t\t\tWe have only four contacts with people. We\nare evaluated and classified by four things\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat we do\r\n\t\t\t\tHow we look\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat we say\r\n\t\t\t\tHow we say it\r\n\t\t\tTo develop courage when you are facing an audience, act as if you already had it or act as if was impossible to fail\r\n\t\t\tEvery talk, regardless of whether the speaker realizes\nit or not, has one of four major goals. (Set your Goal)\r\n\t\t\t\t1. To make something clear.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. To impress and convince.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. To get action.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. To entertain.\r\n\t\t\tConcepts (Eben Pagan's Clear Communication)\r\n\t\t\t\tThe meaning of the communication is the response you get\r\n\t\t\t\tWe must always be checking, testing, confirming and aligning\r\n\t\t\t\tprojection\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the emotional state of someone that had achieved this\r\n\t\t\t\tLying is stressful\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStress is the major killer behind most diseases\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA major cause of stress is lying\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe biggest type of lie is withholding information which diverts people into not know what is going on\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe more you tell the truth\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe more you detect self-deception\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe easier life becomes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe less stress there is\r\n\t\t\tThe Secret of Good Delivery\r\n\t\t\t\t1. There is something besides the mere words in\na talk which counts. It is the flavor with which they are\ndelivered. \"It is not so much what you say as how you\nsay it.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t2. Many speakers ignore their hearers, stare over their\nheads or at the floor. They seem to be delivering a\nsoliloquy. There is no sense of communication, no give and\ntake between the audience and the speaker. That kind of\nattitude would kill a conversation; it also kills a speech.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Good delivery is conversational tone and directness\nenlarged.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Talk to your hearers just as if you expected them to\nstand up in a moment and talk back to you.\r\n\t\t\t\tPut your heart into your talking. Real emotional\nsincerity\r\n\t\t\tPresence and Personality\r\n\t\t\t\tAccording to experiments conducted by the\nCarnegie Institute of Technology, personality has more\nto do with business success than has superior knowledge.\r\n\t\t\t\tDon't speak when you are tired. Rest, recuperate,\nstore up a reserve of energy.\r\n\t\t\t\tDo nothing to dull your energy. It is magnetic. People\ncluster around the energetic speaker like wild geese\naround a field of autumn wheat.\r\n\t\t\t\tSmile. Come before your hearers with an attitude that\nseems to say you are glad to be there.\r\n\t\t\tGeneral pointers\r\n\t\t\t\tStep out briskly and take a deep\nbreath. In fact, breathe deeply for thirty seconds before you\never face your audience. The increased supply of oxygen\nwill build you up and give you courage.\r\n\t\t\t\tStride forth bravely, stop, stand still and act as if you\nloved it.\r\n\t\t\t\tDraw yourself up to your full height, look your audience\nstraight in the eyes, and begin to talk as confidently as if\nevery one of them owed you money.\r\n\t\t\t\tDo not nervously button and unbutton your coat, play\nwith your beads, or fumble with your hands.\r\n\t\t\t\tAs a general rule, it is bad for a speaker to hide behind\nfurniture; but it may give you a little courage the first few\ntimes to stand behind a table or chair and to grip them\ntightly-or hold a coin firmly in the palm of your hand.\r\n\t\t4. Practice! Practice! Practice!\r\n\t\t\tWhat such a man needs is not courage, but nerve control, cool-headedness. This he can get only by actual practice.\r\n\t\t\t\tIt will feel uncomfortable but you must embrace it\r\n\t\t\t\tMost people will not take this much action\r\n\t\t\t\t80% action 20% theory\r\n\t\t\tImproving Your Diction\r\n\t\t\t\tYour diction will be very largely a reflection of the\ncompany you keep.\r\n\t\t\t\tRead with a dictionary by your side. Look up the\nunfamiliar word. Try to find a use for it so that you may\nfix it in your memory.\r\n\t\t\t\tStudy the derivation of the words you use.\r\n\t\t\tConnecting with people, revels to you details about yourself\r\n\t\t\tTake notes on how you can optimize your progress\r\n\t\t\tOptimizations\r\n\t\t\t\tPower\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you clear and specific?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs your eye contact strong but not overbearing?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you energetic?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you being assertive?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking for approval or reading the situation?\r\n\t\t\t\tPresense\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you in the moment?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs your words, body language and voice tonality in alignment?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you focused on who you are speaking with?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs your energy grounded?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you being real or putting on a front?\r\n\t\t\t\tWarmth\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo you have passion for what you are talking about?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you smiling?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs there a sense of feeling and connection with your audience?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs there a sense of compassion in your communication?\r\n\tAction Items\r\n\t\t1. Book time to speak at formal events or host workshops\r\n\t\t2. Start a Youtube channel or an online platform that uses video to communicate\r\n\t\t3. Participate in discussion groups or forums\r\n\t\t4. Speak to at least 5 new people or groups a day in public\r\n\t\t5.

      "text": "Psycho-Cybernetics \nMaxwell Maltz\r\n\tConduct an accurate inventory and \nanalysis of the contents of\nyour self-image.\r\n\t\tYou act, and feel, not according to what things are\nreally like, but according to the image your mind holds\nof what they are like. You have certain mental images of\nyourself, your world, and the people around you, and you\nbehave as though these images were the truth, the reality,\nrather than the things they represent.\r\n\t\t\"Creative imagination\" is not something reserved for\nthe poets, the philosophers, the inventors. It enters into\nour every act. For imagination sets the goal \"picture\"\nwhich our automatic mechanism works on. We act, or\nfail to act, not because of \"will,\" as is so commonly believed,\nbut because of imagination.\r\n\t\tFinding Your Best Self\r\n\t\t\tThe aim of self-image psychology is not to create a fictitious\nself which is all-powerful, arrogant, egoistic, allimportant.\nSuch an image is as inappropriate and\nunrealistic as the inferior image of self. Our aim is to find\nthe \"real self,\" and to bring our mental images of ourselves\nmore in line with \"the objects they represent.\"\r\n\t\tExercise\r\n\t\t\tSet aside a period of 30 minutes each day where you\ncan be alone and undisturbed. Relax and make yourself\nas comfortable as possible. Now close your eyes and exercise\nyour imagination.\r\n\t\t\t\tsee yourself acting and reacting appropriately,\nsuccessfully, ideally. It doesn't matter how you\nacted yesterday. You do not need to try to have faith you\nwill act in the ideal way tomorrow. Your nervous system\nwill take care of that in time—if you continue to practice.\r\n\t\t\t\tmake these pictures as\nvivid and as detailed as possible.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe way to do this is pay attention to small details,\nsights, sounds, objects, in your imagined environment.\r\n\t\t\t\tThis exercise builds new \"memories\" or stored data into\nyour mid-brain and central nervous system. It builds a\nnew image of self. After practicing it for a time, you will\nbe surprised to find yourself \"acting differently,\" more or\nless automatically and spontaneously—\"without trying.\"\r\n\tIdentify erroneous and restrictive programming imbedded in\nyour self-image and systematically alter it to better suit your purposes.\r\n\t\tThe unhappy, failure-type personality cannot develop a\nnew self-image by pure will power, or by arbitrarily deciding\nto. There must be some grounds, some justification,\nsome reason for deciding that the old picture of self is in\nerror, and that a new picture is appropriate. You cannot\nmerely imagine a new self-image; unless you feel that it is\nbased upon truth.\r\n\t\tRemoving Emotional Scars\r\n\t\t\tMany people have inner emotional scars who have\nnever suffered physical injuries. And the result on personality\nis the same. These people have been hurt or injured\nby someone in the past. To guard against future\ninjury from that source they form a spiritual callus, an\nemotional scar to protect their ego. This scar tissue, however,\nnot only \"protects\" them from the individual who\noriginally hurt them—it \"protects\" them against all other\nhuman beings. An emotional wall is built through which\nneither friend nor foe can pass,\r\n\t\t\tThree Rules for Immunizing Yourself\nAgainst Emotional Hurts\r\n\t\t\t\tBE TOO BIG TO \nFEEL THREATENED:\r\n\t\t\t\tA SELF-RELIANT, RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE\nMAKES YOU LESS VULNERABLE:\r\n\t\t\t\tRELAX AWAY EMOTIONAL HURTS:\r\n\t\tDehypnotize Yourself\nFrom False Beliefs\r\n\t\t\tAnd this feeling of inferiority comes about for just one\nreason: We judge ourselves, and measure ourselves, not\nagainst our own \"norm\" or \"par\" but against some other\nindividual's \"norm.\" When we do this, we always, without\nexception, come out second best.\r\n\t\t\tStop measuring yourself against \"their\" standards. You\nare not \"them\" and can never measure up. Neither can\n\"they\" measure up to yours—nor should they. Once you\nsee this simple, rather self-evident truth, accept it and believe\nit, your inferior feelings will vanish.\r\n\t\t\tPhysical relaxation plays a key role in the dehypnotization\nprocess.\r\n\tUse your imagination to reprogram and manage your self-image.\r\n\t\tUnderstanding the psychology of the self can mean the\ndifference between success and failure, love and hate, bitterness\nand happiness. The discovery of the real self can\nrescue a crumbling marriage, recreate a faltering career,\ntransform victims of 'personality failure.' On another\nplane, discovering your real self means the difference between\nfreedom and the compulsions of conformity.\r\n\t\tHow to Unlock\nYour Real Personality\r\n\t\t\tWhen you become too consciously concerned about\n\"what others think\"; when you become too careful to\nconsciously try to please other people; when you become\ntoo sensitive to the real or fancied disapproval of other\npeople—then you have excessive negative feedback, inhibition,\nand poor performance.\r\n\t\t\tPractice Exercises:\r\n\t\t\t\tDon't wonder in advance what\nyou are \"going to say.\" Just open your mouth and say it.\nImprovise as you go along.\r\n\t\t\t\tDon't plan (take no thought for tomorrow). Don't\nthink before you act. Act—and correct your actions as\nyou go along. This advice may seem radical, yet it is actually\nthe way all servo-mechanisms must work.\r\n\t\t\t\tStop criticising yourself. The inhibited person indulges\nin self-critical analysis continually. After each\naction, however simple, he says to himself, \"I wonder if I\nshould have done that.\" After he has gotten up courage\nenough to say something, he immediately says to himself,\n\"Maybe I shouldn't have said\r\n\t\t\t\tMake a habit of speaking louder than usual.\r\n\t\t\t\tLet people know when you like them.\r\n\t\tIngredients of the\n\"Success-Type\" Personality\nand How to Acquire Them\r\n\t\t\tS-ense of direction\r\n\t\t\t\tGet yourself a goal worth working for.\nBetter still, get yourself a project. Decide what you want\nout of a situation. Always have something ahead of you\nto \"look forward to\"—to work for and hope for. Look\nforward, not backward. Develop what one of the automobile\nmanufacturers calls \"the forward look.\" Develop\na \"nostalgia for the future\" instead of for the past.\r\n\t\t\tU-nderstanding\r\n\t\t\t\tLook for and seek out true information\nconcerning yourself, your problems, other people, or the\nsituation, whether it is good news or bad news. Adopt the\nmotto—\"It doesn't matter who's right, but what's right.\"\r\n\t\t\tC-ourage\r\n\t\t\t\tBe willing to make a few mistakes, to suffer\na little pain to get what you want. Don't sell yourself short. You've got the\nresources. But you never know you've got them until you\nact—and give them a chance to work for you.\r\n\t\t\tC-harity\r\n\t\t\t\tTry to develop a genuine appreciation for people by realizing the truth about them\r\n\t\t\t\tTake the trouble to stop and think of the other person's feelings, his viewpoints, his desires and needs.\r\n\t\t\t\tAct as if other people are important and treat them accordingly\r\n\t\t\tE-steem\r\n\t\t\t\tStop carrying around a mental picture of\nyourself as a defeated, worthless person. Stop dramatizing\nyourself as an object of pity and injustice. Use the\npractice exercises in this book to build up an adequate\nself-image.\r\n\t\t\tS-elf-Confidence\r\n\t\t\t\tConfidence is built upon an experience of success.\nWhen we first begin any undertaking, we are likely to have\nlittle confidence, because we have not learned from experience\nthat we can succeed. This is true of learning to\nride a bicycle, speak in public, or perform surgery.\r\n\t\t\t\tUse errors and mistakes as a way to learning—\nthen dismiss them from your mind. Deliberately remember\nand picture to yourself past successes.\r\n\t\t\tS-elf-Acceptance.\r\n\t\t\t\tNo real success or genuine happiness is possible until a\nperson gains some degree of self-acceptance.\r\n\t\t\t\tAccept yourself as you are—and start\nfrom there. Learn to emotionally tolerate imperfection in\nyourself. It is necessary to intellectually recognize our\nshortcomings, but disastrous to hate ourselves because of\nthem.\r\n\tUse your imagination in concert with your self-image to effectively\ncommunicate with your servo-mechanism, so that it acts as\nan Automatic Success Mechanism, moving you steadily toward\nyour goals, including getting back on course when confronted\nwith obstacles.\r\n\t\tServo-mechanisms are so constructed that they automatically\n\"steer\" their way to a goal, target, or \"answer.\" this new concept does not mean that \"YOU\" are a machine, but that your physical brain and body functions as a machine which \"YOU\" operate. This automatic creative mechanism within you can operate in only one way. It must have a target to shoot at.\r\n\t\t\tTwo types\r\n\t\t\t\t(1) where the target, goal, or \"answer\" is known, and the\nobjective is to reach it or accomplish it\r\n\t\t\t\t(2) where the target or \"answer\" is not known and the objective is\nto discover or locate it.\r\n\t\tThe Failure Mechanism:\nHow to Make It Work For You\nInstead of Against You\r\n\t\t\tF-rustration, hopelessness, futility\r\n\t\t\t\tFrustration is an emotional feeling which develops\nwhenever some important goal cannot be realized or when\nsome strong desire is thwarted.\r\n\t\t\t\tChronic frustration usually means that the goals we\nhave set for ourselves are unrealistic, or the image we have\nof ourselves is inadequate, or both.\r\n\t\t\tA—ggressiveness (misdirected)\r\n\t\t\t\tExcessive and misdirected aggressiveness follows frustration\nas night follows day.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe failure-type personality does not direct his aggressiveness\ntoward the accomplishment of a worthwhile goal.\nInstead it is used in such self-destructive channels as\nulcers, high blood pressure, worry, excessive smoking,\ncompulsive overwork, or it may be turned upon other\npersons in the form of irritability, rudeness, gossip, nagging,\nfault-finding.\r\n\t\t\tI-nsecurity\r\n\t\t\t\tThe feeling of insecurity is based upon a concept or belief\nof inner inadequacy. If you feel that you do not\n\"measure up\" to what is required, you feel insecure.\r\n\t\t\t\tSince man is a goal-striving mechanism, the self realizes\nitself fully only when man is moving forward towards\nsomething.\r\n\t\t\tL-oneliness (lack of \"oneness\")\r\n\t\t\t\tDoing things with other people and enjoying\nthings with other people, helps us to forget ourselves. In\nstimulating conversation, in dancing, playing together, or\nin working together for a common goal, we become interested\nin something other than maintaining our own shams\nand pretenses.\r\n\t\t\t\tDevelop some social skill that will add to the happiness\nof other people\r\n\t\t\tU-ncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\tElbert Hubbard said, \"The greatest mistake a man can\nmake is to be afraid of making one.\"\r\n\t\t\t\tUncertainty is a \"way\" of avoiding mistakes, and responsibility.\r\n\t\t\t\tOne \"way\" is to avoid as many decisions as possible,\nand prolong them as much as possible. Another \"way\" is\nto have a handy scapegoat to blame.\r\n\t\t\tR-esentment\r\n\t\t\t\tWhen the failure-type personality looks for a scapegoat or excuse for his failure, he often blames society, \"the system,\" life, the \"breaks.\"\r\n\t\t\t\tHe resents the success\nand happiness of others because it is proof to him that life\nis short-changing him and he is being treated unfairly\r\n\t\t\t\tResentment is an attempt to make our own failure palatable\nby explaining it in terms of unfair treatment, injustice.\r\n\t\t\t\tRemember that your resentment is not caused by other\npersons, events, or circumstances. It is caused by your\nown emotional response—your own reaction. You alone\nhave power over this, and you can control it if you firmly\nconvince yourself that resentment and self-pity are not\nways to happiness and success, but ways to defeat and\nunhappiness.\r\n\t\t\tE—mptiness.\r\n\t\t\t\tA person who has the capacity to enjoy still alive within\nhim finds enjoyment in many ordinary and simple\nthings in life. He also enjoys whatever success in a material\nway he has achieved. The person in whom the capacity\nto enjoy is dead can find enjoyment in nothing.\r\n\t\t\t\tEmptiness is a symptom that you are not living creatively.\nYou either have no goal that is important enough\nto you, or you are not using your talents and efforts in\nstriving toward an important goal.\r\n\t\t\tHow to Use Negative Thinking\r\n\t\t\t\tWe are sensitive to the negative to the extent\nthat it can alert us to danger.\r\n\t\t\t\tWe recognize the negative for what it is—something undesirable—something\nwe don't want—something that does not bring\ngenuine happiness.\r\n\t\t\t\tWe take immediate corrective\naction and substitute an opposite factor from the Success\nMechanism.\r\n\t\tYou Can Acquire\nthe Habit of Happiness\r\n\t\t\t\"The measure of mental health is the disposition to find\ngood everywhere,\" said that most famous moralist, Ralph\nWaldo Emerson.\r\n\t\t\tFor the next 21 days\r\n\t\t\t\t1. I will be as cheerful as possible.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. I will try to feel and act a little more friendly toward other people.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. I am going to be a little less critical and a little more tolerant of other people, their faults, failings and mistakes. I will place the best possible interpretation upon their actions.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Insofar as possible, I am going to act as if success were inevitable, and I already am the sort of personality I want to be.

      "originalText": "Psycho-Cybernetics \nMaxwell Maltz\r\n\tConduct an accurate inventory and \nanalysis of the contents of\nyour self-image.\r\n\t\tYou act, and feel, not according to what things are\nreally like, but according to the image your mind holds\nof what they are like. You have certain mental images of\nyourself, your world, and the people around you, and you\nbehave as though these images were the truth, the reality,\nrather than the things they represent.\r\n\t\t\"Creative imagination\" is not something reserved for\nthe poets, the philosophers, the inventors. It enters into\nour every act. For imagination sets the goal \"picture\"\nwhich our automatic mechanism works on. We act, or\nfail to act, not because of \"will,\" as is so commonly believed,\nbut because of imagination.\r\n\t\tFinding Your Best Self\r\n\t\t\tThe aim of self-image psychology is not to create a fictitious\nself which is all-powerful, arrogant, egoistic, allimportant.\nSuch an image is as inappropriate and\nunrealistic as the inferior image of self. Our aim is to find\nthe \"real self,\" and to bring our mental images of ourselves\nmore in line with \"the objects they represent.\"\r\n\t\tExercise\r\n\t\t\tSet aside a period of 30 minutes each day where you\ncan be alone and undisturbed. Relax and make yourself\nas comfortable as possible. Now close your eyes and exercise\nyour imagination.\r\n\t\t\t\tsee yourself acting and reacting appropriately,\nsuccessfully, ideally. It doesn't matter how you\nacted yesterday. You do not need to try to have faith you\nwill act in the ideal way tomorrow. Your nervous system\nwill take care of that in time—if you continue to practice.\r\n\t\t\t\tmake these pictures as\nvivid and as detailed as possible.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe way to do this is pay attention to small details,\nsights, sounds, objects, in your imagined environment.\r\n\t\t\t\tThis exercise builds new \"memories\" or stored data into\nyour mid-brain and central nervous system. It builds a\nnew image of self. After practicing it for a time, you will\nbe surprised to find yourself \"acting differently,\" more or\nless automatically and spontaneously—\"without trying.\"\r\n\tIdentify erroneous and restrictive programming imbedded in\nyour self-image and systematically alter it to better suit your purposes.\r\n\t\tThe unhappy, failure-type personality cannot develop a\nnew self-image by pure will power, or by arbitrarily deciding\nto. There must be some grounds, some justification,\nsome reason for deciding that the old picture of self is in\nerror, and that a new picture is appropriate. You cannot\nmerely imagine a new self-image; unless you feel that it is\nbased upon truth.\r\n\t\tRemoving Emotional Scars\r\n\t\t\tMany people have inner emotional scars who have\nnever suffered physical injuries. And the result on personality\nis the same. These people have been hurt or injured\nby someone in the past. To guard against future\ninjury from that source they form a spiritual callus, an\nemotional scar to protect their ego. This scar tissue, however,\nnot only \"protects\" them from the individual who\noriginally hurt them—it \"protects\" them against all other\nhuman beings. An emotional wall is built through which\nneither friend nor foe can pass,\r\n\t\t\tThree Rules for Immunizing Yourself\nAgainst Emotional Hurts\r\n\t\t\t\tBE TOO BIG TO \nFEEL THREATENED:\r\n\t\t\t\tA SELF-RELIANT, RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE\nMAKES YOU LESS VULNERABLE:\r\n\t\t\t\tRELAX AWAY EMOTIONAL HURTS:\r\n\t\tDehypnotize Yourself\nFrom False Beliefs\r\n\t\t\tAnd this feeling of inferiority comes about for just one\nreason: We judge ourselves, and measure ourselves, not\nagainst our own \"norm\" or \"par\" but against some other\nindividual's \"norm.\" When we do this, we always, without\nexception, come out second best.\r\n\t\t\tStop measuring yourself against \"their\" standards. You\nare not \"them\" and can never measure up. Neither can\n\"they\" measure up to yours—nor should they. Once you\nsee this simple, rather self-evident truth, accept it and believe\nit, your inferior feelings will vanish.\r\n\t\t\tPhysical relaxation plays a key role in the dehypnotization\nprocess.\r\n\tUse your imagination to reprogram and manage your self-image.\r\n\t\tUnderstanding the psychology of the self can mean the\ndifference between success and failure, love and hate, bitterness\nand happiness. The discovery of the real self can\nrescue a crumbling marriage, recreate a faltering career,\ntransform victims of 'personality failure.' On another\nplane, discovering your real self means the difference between\nfreedom and the compulsions of conformity.\r\n\t\tHow to Unlock\nYour Real Personality\r\n\t\t\tWhen you become too consciously concerned about\n\"what others think\"; when you become too careful to\nconsciously try to please other people; when you become\ntoo sensitive to the real or fancied disapproval of other\npeople—then you have excessive negative feedback, inhibition,\nand poor performance.\r\n\t\t\tPractice Exercises:\r\n\t\t\t\tDon't wonder in advance what\nyou are \"going to say.\" Just open your mouth and say it.\nImprovise as you go along.\r\n\t\t\t\tDon't plan (take no thought for tomorrow). Don't\nthink before you act. Act—and correct your actions as\nyou go along. This advice may seem radical, yet it is actually\nthe way all servo-mechanisms must work.\r\n\t\t\t\tStop criticising yourself. The inhibited person indulges\nin self-critical analysis continually. After each\naction, however simple, he says to himself, \"I wonder if I\nshould have done that.\" After he has gotten up courage\nenough to say something, he immediately says to himself,\n\"Maybe I shouldn't have said\r\n\t\t\t\tMake a habit of speaking louder than usual.\r\n\t\t\t\tLet people know when you like them.\r\n\t\tIngredients of the\n\"Success-Type\" Personality\nand How to Acquire Them\r\n\t\t\tS-ense of direction\r\n\t\t\t\tGet yourself a goal worth working for.\nBetter still, get yourself a project. Decide what you want\nout of a situation. Always have something ahead of you\nto \"look forward to\"—to work for and hope for. Look\nforward, not backward. Develop what one of the automobile\nmanufacturers calls \"the forward look.\" Develop\na \"nostalgia for the future\" instead of for the past.\r\n\t\t\tU-nderstanding\r\n\t\t\t\tLook for and seek out true information\nconcerning yourself, your problems, other people, or the\nsituation, whether it is good news or bad news. Adopt the\nmotto—\"It doesn't matter who's right, but what's right.\"\r\n\t\t\tC-ourage\r\n\t\t\t\tBe willing to make a few mistakes, to suffer\na little pain to get what you want. Don't sell yourself short. You've got the\nresources. But you never know you've got them until you\nact—and give them a chance to work for you.\r\n\t\t\tC-harity\r\n\t\t\t\tTry to develop a genuine appreciation for people by realizing the truth about them\r\n\t\t\t\tTake the trouble to stop and think of the other person's feelings, his viewpoints, his desires and needs.\r\n\t\t\t\tAct as if other people are important and treat them accordingly\r\n\t\t\tE-steem\r\n\t\t\t\tStop carrying around a mental picture of\nyourself as a defeated, worthless person. Stop dramatizing\nyourself as an object of pity and injustice. Use the\npractice exercises in this book to build up an adequate\nself-image.\r\n\t\t\tS-elf-Confidence\r\n\t\t\t\tConfidence is built upon an experience of success.\nWhen we first begin any undertaking, we are likely to have\nlittle confidence, because we have not learned from experience\nthat we can succeed. This is true of learning to\nride a bicycle, speak in public, or perform surgery.\r\n\t\t\t\tUse errors and mistakes as a way to learning—\nthen dismiss them from your mind. Deliberately remember\nand picture to yourself past successes.\r\n\t\t\tS-elf-Acceptance.\r\n\t\t\t\tNo real success or genuine happiness is possible until a\nperson gains some degree of self-acceptance.\r\n\t\t\t\tAccept yourself as you are—and start\nfrom there. Learn to emotionally tolerate imperfection in\nyourself. It is necessary to intellectually recognize our\nshortcomings, but disastrous to hate ourselves because of\nthem.\r\n\tUse your imagination in concert with your self-image to effectively\ncommunicate with your servo-mechanism, so that it acts as\nan Automatic Success Mechanism, moving you steadily toward\nyour goals, including getting back on course when confronted\nwith obstacles.\r\n\t\tServo-mechanisms are so constructed that they automatically\n\"steer\" their way to a goal, target, or \"answer.\" this new concept does not mean that \"YOU\" are a machine, but that your physical brain and body functions as a machine which \"YOU\" operate. This automatic creative mechanism within you can operate in only one way. It must have a target to shoot at.\r\n\t\t\tTwo types\r\n\t\t\t\t(1) where the target, goal, or \"answer\" is known, and the\nobjective is to reach it or accomplish it\r\n\t\t\t\t(2) where the target or \"answer\" is not known and the objective is\nto discover or locate it.\r\n\t\tThe Failure Mechanism:\nHow to Make It Work For You\nInstead of Against You\r\n\t\t\tF-rustration, hopelessness, futility\r\n\t\t\t\tFrustration is an emotional feeling which develops\nwhenever some important goal cannot be realized or when\nsome strong desire is thwarted.\r\n\t\t\t\tChronic frustration usually means that the goals we\nhave set for ourselves are unrealistic, or the image we have\nof ourselves is inadequate, or both.\r\n\t\t\tA—ggressiveness (misdirected)\r\n\t\t\t\tExcessive and misdirected aggressiveness follows frustration\nas night follows day.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe failure-type personality does not direct his aggressiveness\ntoward the accomplishment of a worthwhile goal.\nInstead it is used in such self-destructive channels as\nulcers, high blood pressure, worry, excessive smoking,\ncompulsive overwork, or it may be turned upon other\npersons in the form of irritability, rudeness, gossip, nagging,\nfault-finding.\r\n\t\t\tI-nsecurity\r\n\t\t\t\tThe feeling of insecurity is based upon a concept or belief\nof inner inadequacy. If you feel that you do not\n\"measure up\" to what is required, you feel insecure.\r\n\t\t\t\tSince man is a goal-striving mechanism, the self realizes\nitself fully only when man is moving forward towards\nsomething.\r\n\t\t\tL-oneliness (lack of \"oneness\")\r\n\t\t\t\tDoing things with other people and enjoying\nthings with other people, helps us to forget ourselves. In\nstimulating conversation, in dancing, playing together, or\nin working together for a common goal, we become interested\nin something other than maintaining our own shams\nand pretenses.\r\n\t\t\t\tDevelop some social skill that will add to the happiness\nof other people\r\n\t\t\tU-ncertainty\r\n\t\t\t\tElbert Hubbard said, \"The greatest mistake a man can\nmake is to be afraid of making one.\"\r\n\t\t\t\tUncertainty is a \"way\" of avoiding mistakes, and responsibility.\r\n\t\t\t\tOne \"way\" is to avoid as many decisions as possible,\nand prolong them as much as possible. Another \"way\" is\nto have a handy scapegoat to blame.\r\n\t\t\tR-esentment\r\n\t\t\t\tWhen the failure-type personality looks for a scapegoat or excuse for his failure, he often blames society, \"the system,\" life, the \"breaks.\"\r\n\t\t\t\tHe resents the success\nand happiness of others because it is proof to him that life\nis short-changing him and he is being treated unfairly\r\n\t\t\t\tResentment is an attempt to make our own failure palatable\nby explaining it in terms of unfair treatment, injustice.\r\n\t\t\t\tRemember that your resentment is not caused by other\npersons, events, or circumstances. It is caused by your\nown emotional response—your own reaction. You alone\nhave power over this, and you can control it if you firmly\nconvince yourself that resentment and self-pity are not\nways to happiness and success, but ways to defeat and\nunhappiness.\r\n\t\t\tE—mptiness.\r\n\t\t\t\tA person who has the capacity to enjoy still alive within\nhim finds enjoyment in many ordinary and simple\nthings in life. He also enjoys whatever success in a material\nway he has achieved. The person in whom the capacity\nto enjoy is dead can find enjoyment in nothing.\r\n\t\t\t\tEmptiness is a symptom that you are not living creatively.\nYou either have no goal that is important enough\nto you, or you are not using your talents and efforts in\nstriving toward an important goal.\r\n\t\t\tHow to Use Negative Thinking\r\n\t\t\t\tWe are sensitive to the negative to the extent\nthat it can alert us to danger.\r\n\t\t\t\tWe recognize the negative for what it is—something undesirable—something\nwe don't want—something that does not bring\ngenuine happiness.\r\n\t\t\t\tWe take immediate corrective\naction and substitute an opposite factor from the Success\nMechanism.\r\n\t\tYou Can Acquire\nthe Habit of Happiness\r\n\t\t\t\"The measure of mental health is the disposition to find\ngood everywhere,\" said that most famous moralist, Ralph\nWaldo Emerson.\r\n\t\t\tFor the next 21 days\r\n\t\t\t\t1. I will be as cheerful as possible.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. I will try to feel and act a little more friendly toward other people.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. I am going to be a little less critical and a little more tolerant of other people, their faults, failings and mistakes. I will place the best possible interpretation upon their actions.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Insofar as possible, I am going to act as if success were inevitable, and I already am the sort of personality I want to be. I will practice \"acting like\" and \"feeling like\" this new personality.\r\n\t\t\t\t5. I will not let my own opinion color facts in a pessimistic or negative way.\r\n\t\t\t\t6.

(2022 Interpretations) \n\tPremise\n\t\tDoes a firm persuasion that a thing is so, make it so?\" He replied, \"All poets believe it does. \n\nAnd in ages of imagination, this firm persuasion removes mountains; but many are not capable of firm persuasion of anything.\n\n- William Blake\n\t\t\n\tInner Changes\n\t\tIf our genes don’t seal our fate and if they actually contain an enormous library of possibilities just waiting to be taken off the shelf and read.\n\nThe word epigenetics literally means “above the gene.” It refers to the control of genes not from within the DNA itself but from messages coming from outside the cell—in other words, from the environment.\n\t\t\tEpigenetics teaches that we, indeed, are not doomed by our genes and that a change in human consciousness can produce physical changes, both in structure and function, in the human body. \n\nWe can modify our genetic destiny by turning on the genes we want and turning off the ones we don’t want through working with the various factors in the environment that program our genes. \n\nSome of those signals come from within the body, such as feelings and thoughts, while others come from the body’s response to the external environment\n\t\t\tThe study of epigenetics raises the question: What if nothing is changing in your external environment? What if you do the same things with the same people at exactly the same time every day—things leading to the same experiences that produce the same emotions that signal the same genes in the same way?\n\nWe could say that as long as you perceive your life through the lens of the past and react to the conditions with the same neural architecture and from the same level of mind, you’re headed toward a very specific, predetermined genetic destiny. \n\nIn addition, what you believe about yourself, your life, and the choices you make as a result of those beliefs also keeps sending the same messages to the same genes.\n\nOnly when the cell is ignited in a new way, by new information, can it create thousands of variations of the same gene to rewrite a new expression of proteins—which changes your body. \n\nYour beliefs, your perceptions, and how you interact with your external environment have an influence on your internal environment, which is still the external environment of the cell. \n\nThis means that you—not your preprogrammed biology—hold the keys to your genetic destiny. It’s just a matter of finding the right key that fits into the right lock to unleash your potential.”\n\n\t\tMental Rehearsal\n\t\t\tIf you continue to mentally practice enough times this new series of choices, behaviors, and experiences that you desire, reproducing the same new level of mind over and over again, then your brain will begin to physically change—installing new neurological circuitry to begin to think from that new level of mind—to look as if the experience has already happened. \n\t\t\tThis technique is basically closing your eyes and repeatedly imagining performing an action, and mentally reviewing the future you want.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\tSuggestion via Mental Rehearsal\n\t\t\tBrainwave States\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTheta Mental Rehearsal\n\t\t\t\tTo be happy with yourself in the present moment while maintaining a dream of your future is a grand recipe for manifestation. \n\nWhen you feel so whole that you no longer care whether “it” will happen, that’s when amazing things materialize before your eyes. \n\nI’ve learned that being whole is the perfect state of creation. \n\nI’ve seen this time and time again in witnessing true healings in people all over the world. \n\nThey feel so complete that they no longer want, no longer feel lack, and no longer try to do it themselves. \n\nThey let go, and to their amazement, something greater than they are responds—and they laugh at the simplicity of the process.\n\t\t\t\t1. Find a time and place where you won't be interrupted.\n\t\t\t\t2. Close your eyes. Relax, take deep breaths and exhale slowly.  Free your mind of distractions and allow your mind to focus on the relaxation process.\n\t\t\t\t3. Ask yourself, what would it look like if it were true? INTENTION\n\t\t\t\t4. Rehearse the specific performance that implies. Visualize yourself as an active participant.\n\t\t\t\t5.

(2022 Interpretations) \n\tPremise\n\t\tDoes a firm persuasion that a thing is so, make it so?\" He replied, \"All poets believe it does. \n\nAnd in ages of imagination, this firm persuasion removes mountains; but many are not capable of firm persuasion of anything.\n\n- William Blake\n\t\t\n\tInner Changes\n\t\tIf our genes don’t seal our fate and if they actually contain an enormous library of possibilities just waiting to be taken off the shelf and read.\n\nThe word epigenetics literally means “above the gene.” It refers to the control of genes not from within the DNA itself but from messages coming from outside the cell—in other words, from the environment.\n\t\t\tEpigenetics teaches that we, indeed, are not doomed by our genes and that a change in human consciousness can produce physical changes, both in structure and function, in the human body. \n\nWe can modify our genetic destiny by turning on the genes we want and turning off the ones we don’t want through working with the various factors in the environment that program our genes. \n\nSome of those signals come from within the body, such as feelings and thoughts, while others come from the body’s response to the external environment\n\t\t\tThe study of epigenetics raises the question: What if nothing is changing in your external environment? What if you do the same things with the same people at exactly the same time every day—things leading to the same experiences that produce the same emotions that signal the same genes in the same way?\n\nWe could say that as long as you perceive your life through the lens of the past and react to the conditions with the same neural architecture and from the same level of mind, you’re headed toward a very specific, predetermined genetic destiny. \n\nIn addition, what you believe about yourself, your life, and the choices you make as a result of those beliefs also keeps sending the same messages to the same genes.\n\nOnly when the cell is ignited in a new way, by new information, can it create thousands of variations of the same gene to rewrite a new expression of proteins—which changes your body. \n\nYour beliefs, your perceptions, and how you interact with your external environment have an influence on your internal environment, which is still the external environment of the cell. \n\nThis means that you—not your preprogrammed biology—hold the keys to your genetic destiny. It’s just a matter of finding the right key that fits into the right lock to unleash your potential.”\n\n\t\tMental Rehearsal\n\t\t\tIf you continue to mentally practice enough times this new series of choices, behaviors, and experiences that you desire, reproducing the same new level of mind over and over again, then your brain will begin to physically change—installing new neurological circuitry to begin to think from that new level of mind—to look as if the experience has already happened. \n\t\t\tThis technique is basically closing your eyes and repeatedly imagining performing an action, and mentally reviewing the future you want.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\tSuggestion via Mental Rehearsal\n\t\t\tBrainwave States\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTheta Mental Rehearsal\n\t\t\t\tTo be happy with yourself in the present moment while maintaining a dream of your future is a grand recipe for manifestation. \n\nWhen you feel so whole that you no longer care whether “it” will happen, that’s when amazing things materialize before your eyes. \n\nI’ve learned that being whole is the perfect state of creation. \n\nI’ve seen this time and time again in witnessing true healings in people all over the world. \n\nThey feel so complete that they no longer want, no longer feel lack, and no longer try to do it themselves. \n\nThey let go, and to their amazement, something greater than they are responds—and they laugh at the simplicity of the process.\n\t\t\t\t1. Find a time and place where you won't be interrupted.\n\t\t\t\t2. Close your eyes. Relax, take deep breaths and exhale slowly.  Free your mind of distractions and allow your mind to focus on the relaxation process.\n\t\t\t\t3. Ask yourself, what would it look like if it were true? INTENTION\n\t\t\t\t4. Rehearse the specific performance that implies. Visualize yourself as an active participant.\n\t\t\t\t5. Repeat the process, again and again till you feel it as reality (You will feel the wholeness)\n\t\t\t\t6. Open your eyes and go about your day knowing that you have intiated the changes"

Review the past, but only for the purpose of making a better plan. Review, understand and take responsibility for the errors that you made and use it as a tool to do differently in the future.\n\t\tA clear vision of the future will pull you past whatever friction or static you experience in the present\n\t\tThe path to mastery is distorted with promises of instant gratification, instant success and fast temporary relief\n\t\tThe pursuit of any goal is a slight edge continuous journey of continuous improvement, learning and refinement.\n\t\tDon't become too grown up to take baby steps\n\t\tThe definite of purpose and the burning desire to possess it as your fuel\n\t\tWhen you are formulating your goals and vision of your future be careful who you share it with.

He is the one who fulfills the suggestion, “Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think on these things.” Philippians 4:8\n\t\tBackward review\n\t\t\tVersion 1: To aid in mastering the control of your attention, practice this exercise:\n\nNight after night, just before you drift off to sleep, strive to hold your attention on the activities of the day in reverse order. Focus your attention on the last thing you did, that is, getting in to bed, and then move it backward in time over the events until you reach the first event of the day, getting out of bed. This is no easy exercise, but just as specific exercises greatly help in developing specific muscles, this will greatly help in developing the \"muscle\" of your attention.\n\nYour attention must be developed, controlled, and concentrated in order to change your concept of yourself successfully and thereby change your future.  (Power of Awareness) \n\t\t\tVersion 2: So don’t judge it, because you are the source of the thing that you are beholding. Now turn within and prune it by using these pruning shears of revision.\n\nNow this is how we do it. At the end of my day, I review the day; I don’t judge it, I simply review it. I look over the entire day, all the episodes, all the events, all the conversations, all the meetings, and then as I see it clearly in my mind’s eye, I rewrite it. \n\nI rewrite it and make it conform to the ideal day I wish I had experienced. I take scene after scene and rewrite it, revise it, and having revised my day, then in my imagination I relive that day, the revised day, and I do it over and over in my imagination until this seeming imagined state begins to take on to me the tones of reality. \n\nIt seems that it’s real, that I actually did experience it and I have found from experience that these revised days, if really lived, will change my tomorrows. \n\nWhen I meet people tomorrow that today disappointed me, they will not tomorrow, for in me I have changed the very nature of that being, and having changed him, he bears witness tomorrow of the change that took place within me. It is my duty to take this garden and really make it a garden by daily using the pruning shears of revision."

It is a delusion that, other than assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you can do anything to aid the realization of your desire. \n\nYou think that you can do something, you want to do something; but actually, you can do nothing. \n\nThe illusion of the free will to do is but ignorance of the law of assumption upon which all action is based.\n\nEverything happens automatically.\n\nAll that befalls you, all that is done by you happens. \n\nYour assumptions, conscious or unconscious, direct all thought and action to their fulfillment\n\tCreation is finished, and all events are taking place now.\n\t\tThis is what is meant by creation, and the statement that creation is finished means nothing is ever to be created, it is only to be manifested. \n\nWhat is called creativeness is only becoming aware of what already is. You simply become aware of increasing\nportions of that which already exists.\n\t\tIf creation is finished, and all events are taking place now, the question that springs naturally to the mind is \"what determines your time track?\"\n\nThat is, what determines the events which you encounter? And the answer is your concept of yourself. Concepts determine the route that attention follows. Here is a good test to prove this fact.

      "originalText": "Everything happens automatically from the Vision\n\tPremise\n\t\t\n\t\tThe question is often asked, \"What should be done between the assumption of the wish fulfilled and its realization?\"\n\n\nNothing. It is a delusion that, other than assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you can do anything to aid the realization of your desire. \n\nYou think that you can do something, you want to do something; but actually, you can do nothing. \n\nThe illusion of the free will to do is but ignorance of the law of assumption upon which all action is based.\n\nEverything happens automatically.\n\nAll that befalls you, all that is done by you happens. \n\nYour assumptions, conscious or unconscious, direct all thought and action to their fulfillment\n\tCreation is finished, and all events are taking place now.\n\t\tThis is what is meant by creation, and the statement that creation is finished means nothing is ever to be created, it is only to be manifested. \n\nWhat is called creativeness is only becoming aware of what already is. You simply become aware of increasing\nportions of that which already exists.\n\t\tIf creation is finished, and all events are taking place now, the question that springs naturally to the mind is \"what determines your time track?\"\n\nThat is, what determines the events which you encounter? And the answer is your concept of yourself. Concepts determine the route that attention follows. Here is a good test to prove this fact. Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and observe the route that your attention follows.\n\t\tThe \"light\" is consciousness.\n\nConsciousness is one, manifesting in legions of forms or levels of consciousness.\n\nThere is no one that is not all that is, for consciousness, though expressed in an infinite series of levels, is not divisional.\n\nThere is no real separation or gap in\nconsciousness.

      "text": "The Dual Nature of Consciousness \nNeville Goddard\r\n\tThe ONE consciousness which includes subconscious and conscious\r\n\t\tA clear concept of the dual nature of man's consciousness must be the basis of all true prayer. Consciousness includes a subconscious as well as a conscious part. The infinitely greater part of consciousness lies below the sphere of objective consciousness. \n\nThe subconscious is the most important part of consciousness. It is the cause of voluntary action. The subconscious is what a man is. The conscious is what a man knows. \"I and my Father are one but my Father is greater than I.\" The conscious and subconscious are one, but the subconscious is greater than the conscious.\r\n\t\t\"I of myself can do nothing, the Father within me He doeth the work.\" I, objective consciousness, of myself can do nothing; the Father, the subconscious, He doeth the work. The subconscious is that in which everything is known, in which everything is possible, to which everything goes, from which everything comes, which belongs to all, to which all have access.\r\n\tAlignment with the five senses via assumption\r\n\t\tThe conscious mind reasons inductively from observation, experience and education. It therefore finds it difficult to believe what the five senses and inductive reason deny. \n\nThe subconscious reasons deductively and is never concerned with the truth or falsity of the premise, but proceeds on the assumption of the correctness of the premise and objectifies results which are consistent with the premise. This distinction must be clearly seen by all who would master the art of praying. \n\nNo true grasp of the science of prayer can be really obtained until the laws governing the dual nature of consciousness are understood and the importance of the subconscious realized.\r\n\t\tWhat we are conscious of is constructed out of what we are not conscious of. \n\nNot only do our subconscious assumptions influence our behavior but they also fashion the pattern of our objective existence. \n\nThey alone have the power to say, \"Let us make man objective manifestations in our image, after our likeness.\" The whole of creation is asleep within the deep of man and is awakened to objective existence by his subconscious assumptions. \n\nWithin that blankness we call sleep there is a consciousness in unsleeping vigilance, and while the body sleeps this unsleeping being releases from the treasure house of eternity the subconscious assumptions of man.\r\n\tPrayer, the art of believing \r\n\t\tPrayer the art of believing what is denied by the senses deals almost entirely with the subconscious. \n\nThrough prayer, the subconscious is suggested into acceptance of the wish fulfilled, and, reasoning deductively, logically unfolds it to its legitimate end. \"Far greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.\"\r\n\t\tPrayer is the key which unlocks the infinite storehouse. \"Prove me now here with, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\n\n\"Prayer modifies or completely changes our subconscious assumptions, and a change of assumption is a change of expression.\"\r\n\t\tThe subjective mind is completely controlled by suggestion.

      "originalText": "The Dual Nature of Consciousness \nNeville Goddard\r\n\tThe ONE consciousness which includes subconscious and conscious\r\n\t\tA clear concept of the dual nature of man's consciousness must be the basis of all true prayer. Consciousness includes a subconscious as well as a conscious part. The infinitely greater part of consciousness lies below the sphere of objective consciousness. \n\nThe subconscious is the most important part of consciousness. It is the cause of voluntary action. The subconscious is what a man is. The conscious is what a man knows. \"I and my Father are one but my Father is greater than I.\" The conscious and subconscious are one, but the subconscious is greater than the conscious.\r\n\t\t\"I of myself can do nothing, the Father within me He doeth the work.\" I, objective consciousness, of myself can do nothing; the Father, the subconscious, He doeth the work. The subconscious is that in which everything is known, in which everything is possible, to which everything goes, from which everything comes, which belongs to all, to which all have access.\r\n\tAlignment with the five senses via assumption\r\n\t\tThe conscious mind reasons inductively from observation, experience and education. It therefore finds it difficult to believe what the five senses and inductive reason deny. \n\nThe subconscious reasons deductively and is never concerned with the truth or falsity of the premise, but proceeds on the assumption of the correctness of the premise and objectifies results which are consistent with the premise. This distinction must be clearly seen by all who would master the art of praying. \n\nNo true grasp of the science of prayer can be really obtained until the laws governing the dual nature of consciousness are understood and the importance of the subconscious realized.\r\n\t\tWhat we are conscious of is constructed out of what we are not conscious of. \n\nNot only do our subconscious assumptions influence our behavior but they also fashion the pattern of our objective existence. \n\nThey alone have the power to say, \"Let us make man objective manifestations in our image, after our likeness.\" The whole of creation is asleep within the deep of man and is awakened to objective existence by his subconscious assumptions. \n\nWithin that blankness we call sleep there is a consciousness in unsleeping vigilance, and while the body sleeps this unsleeping being releases from the treasure house of eternity the subconscious assumptions of man.\r\n\tPrayer, the art of believing \r\n\t\tPrayer the art of believing what is denied by the senses deals almost entirely with the subconscious. \n\nThrough prayer, the subconscious is suggested into acceptance of the wish fulfilled, and, reasoning deductively, logically unfolds it to its legitimate end. \"Far greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.\"\r\n\t\tPrayer is the key which unlocks the infinite storehouse. \"Prove me now here with, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\n\n\"Prayer modifies or completely changes our subconscious assumptions, and a change of assumption is a change of expression.\"\r\n\t\tThe subjective mind is completely controlled by suggestion. Ideas are best suggested when the objective mind is partly subjective, that is, when the objective senses are diminished or held in abeyance. \n\nThis partly subjective state can best be described as controlled reverie, wherein the mind is passive but capable of functioning with absorption. \n\nIt is a concentration of attention. There must be no conflict in your mind when you are praying. Turn from what is to what ought to be. Assume the mood of fulfilled desire, and by the universal law of reversibility you will realize your desire.\r\n\tThe ONE consciousness in ALL\r\n\t\tThe subjective mind is the diffused consciousness that animates the world; it is the spirit that giveth life. In all substance is a single soul subjective mind. Through all creation runs this one unbroken subjective mind. \n\nThought and feeling fused into beliefs impress modifications upon it, charge it with a mission, which mission it faithfully executes.\r\n\t\tMan transmits ideas to the subconscious through his feelings. The subconscious transmits ideas from mind to mind through telepathy.\r\n\t\tThe only ideas they subconsciously reject are your ideas of them which they could not wish to be true of anyone. \n\nWhatever they could wish for others can be believed of them, and by the law of belief which governs subjective reasoning they are compelled to subjectively accept, and therefore objectively express, accordingly."

      "text": "The Science of Being Great\nWallace D. Wattles\r\n\tThere is a Principle of Power in you; if you use it and apply it in a certain way you can overcome all heredity, and master all circumstances and conditions and become a great and powerful personality.\r\n\t\tGreatness exists in all individuals and building a relationship with our inner voice reveals our greatness\r\n\t\tFacts that exist in the external world that hinder or diminish your greatness do not need to be entertained or they will break the connection to your true identity.\r\n\t\tCircumstances reveal to you about yourself and elements of beliefs that you have identified with from five sensory data plus meaning\r\n\tDo not let other people decide what you are to be. Be what you feel that you want to be.\r\n\t\tPeople may think they know what is best for you when they can truly never know what it is like to be you.\r\n\t\tEach individual is so unique that only they themselves understand what is their own greatness.\r\n\t\tThat what uplifts your spirits is that what you were destined to be.\r\n\tWisdom is the power to perceive the best ends to aim at and the best means for reaching those ends. It is the power to perceive the right thing to do… Processes of reason do not often reach knowledge of truth.\r\n\t\tPerception is found within and may be altered by borrowing perceptions of another rather than understanding our own perception\r\n\t\tBoth the end is determined within and the means for reaching the end is found within. \r\n\t\tThere are many reasonable ways that have been discovered to reach an end result and there are many more reasonable ways that have not been discovered to reach the end result. The way is to realize our own unique way to express our own greatness\r\n\tThe use of prayer and affirmation is to change your habit of thought. Any act, mental or physical, often repeated, becomes a habit. The purpose of mental exercises is to repeat certain thoughts over and over until the thinking of those thoughts becomes constant and habitual. The thoughts we continually repeat become convictions.\r\n\t\tA single new thought reflected upon from many different perspectives will lead to a habitual thought.\r\n\t\tSupporting information consumed from people, environment and circumstance that is harmonious to your greatness will affirm the thoughts, emotions and behaviours that reflect. \r\n\t\tThoughts become convictions which harden into facts as far as the five senses perceive\r\n\tGREATNESS is only attained by the constant thinking of great thoughts. No man can become great in outward personality until he is great internally; and no man can be great internally until he THINKS.\r\n\t\tSurround yourself with information that affirms your greatness and you will find yourself subconsciously expressing it automatically.\r\n\t\tWe can create and feed our mind greatness based sensory input via the imagination and it can be made to be more powerful and impressive that five sensory data plus meaning.\r\n\t\tThe outer world is a reflection of the inner world. Greatness within is reflected through people, environment and circumstance in the external world.\r\n\tThe function of the will is to direct thought. Think about the good side of men; the lovely, attractive part, and exert your will in refusing to think of anything else in connection with them.\r\n\t\tWhat you think of others is how you think of yourself.\r\n\t\tHow you express to others is how they will reflect to you.\r\n\t\tWe evoke the aspects in another that are our convictions of them within.\r\n\tALL men are made of the one intelligent substance, and therefore all contain the same essential powers and possibilities. Greatness is equally inherent in all, and may be manifested by all. Every person may become great. Every constituent of God is a constituent of man.\r\n\t\tInfinite Intelligence that created everything is available within us by connecting with our inner voice and making identifying our greatness and expressing it a priority.\r\n\t\tThe one intelligent substance reveals to you your own version of greatness in your imagination that is true for you to bring forth.\r\n\t\tThe spirit of harmony is your world where all within it are realizing their own greatness and expressing it to co-create harmoniously.",

      "originalText": "The Science of Being Great\nWallace D. Wattles\r\n\tThere is a Principle of Power in you; if you use it and apply it in a certain way you can overcome all heredity, and master all circumstances and conditions and become a great and powerful personality.\r\n\t\tGreatness exists in all individuals and building a relationship with our inner voice reveals our greatness\r\n\t\tFacts that exist in the external world that hinder or diminish your greatness do not need to be entertained or they will break the connection to your true identity.\r\n\t\tCircumstances reveal to you about yourself and elements of beliefs that you have identified with from five sensory data plus meaning\r\n\tDo not let other people decide what you are to be. Be what you feel that you want to be.\r\n\t\tPeople may think they know what is best for you when they can truly never know what it is like to be you.\r\n\t\tEach individual is so unique that only they themselves understand what is their own greatness.\r\n\t\tThat what uplifts your spirits is that what you were destined to be.\r\n\tWisdom is the power to perceive the best ends to aim at and the best means for reaching those ends. It is the power to perceive the right thing to do… Processes of reason do not often reach knowledge of truth.\r\n\t\tPerception is found within and may be altered by borrowing perceptions of another rather than understanding our own perception\r\n\t\tBoth the end is determined within and the means for reaching the end is found within. \r\n\t\tThere are many reasonable ways that have been discovered to reach an end result and there are many more reasonable ways that have not been discovered to reach the end result. The way is to realize our own unique way to express our own greatness\r\n\tThe use of prayer and affirmation is to change your habit of thought. Any act, mental or physical, often repeated, becomes a habit. The purpose of mental exercises is to repeat certain thoughts over and over until the thinking of those thoughts becomes constant and habitual. The thoughts we continually repeat become convictions.\r\n\t\tA single new thought reflected upon from many different perspectives will lead to a habitual thought.\r\n\t\tSupporting information consumed from people, environment and circumstance that is harmonious to your greatness will affirm the thoughts, emotions and behaviours that reflect. \r\n\t\tThoughts become convictions which harden into facts as far as the five senses perceive\r\n\tGREATNESS is only attained by the constant thinking of great thoughts. No man can become great in outward personality until he is great internally; and no man can be great internally until he THINKS.\r\n\t\tSurround yourself with information that affirms your greatness and you will find yourself subconsciously expressing it automatically.\r\n\t\tWe can create and feed our mind greatness based sensory input via the imagination and it can be made to be more powerful and impressive that five sensory data plus meaning.\r\n\t\tThe outer world is a reflection of the inner world. Greatness within is reflected through people, environment and circumstance in the external world.\r\n\tThe function of the will is to direct thought. Think about the good side of men; the lovely, attractive part, and exert your will in refusing to think of anything else in connection with them.\r\n\t\tWhat you think of others is how you think of yourself.\r\n\t\tHow you express to others is how they will reflect to you.\r\n\t\tWe evoke the aspects in another that are our convictions of them within.\r\n\tALL men are made of the one intelligent substance, and therefore all contain the same essential powers and possibilities. Greatness is equally inherent in all, and may be manifested by all. Every person may become great. Every constituent of God is a constituent of man.\r\n\t\tInfinite Intelligence that created everything is available within us by connecting with our inner voice and making identifying our greatness and expressing it a priority.\r\n\t\tThe one intelligent substance reveals to you your own version of greatness in your imagination that is true for you to bring forth.\r\n\t\tThe spirit of harmony is your world where all within it are realizing their own greatness and expressing it to co-create harmoniously."

My children are in bed asleep and I cannot come down and give you what you want.\" Then this statement is made: \"But because of the man's importunity, he was given all that he desired.\" The word “importunity” means \"brazen impudence.\" Having a desire, the man would not take no for an answer!\r\n\t\t\tImagine yourself into the reality\r\n\t\t\t\tDwell in and from the identify which is ONE with the vision. \r\n\t\t\t\twhat does it feel like?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHave flow, joy and embody via naturalness.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJoy is a natural state which shifts us into the ideal state of mind\r\n\t\t\t\tBy giving excessive meaning of disharmony between where we are right now and where we want to be,  we recall another reality\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat we focus reveals where what reality we are dwelling in.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThinking\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHabits\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEmotional integration\r\n\t\t\tknow that is already exsists\r\n\t\t\tif it did not exsist, you would now have had the idea.\r\n\t\t\ta reality where everything is great, the end result\r\n\t\tOnly by much searching and mining, are gold and diamonds obtained, and man can find every truth connected with his being, if he will dig deep into the mine of his soul; and that he is the maker of his character, the moulder of his life, and the builder of his destiny, he may unerringly prove, if he will watch, control, and alter his thoughts, tracing their effects upon himself, upon others, and upon his life and circumstances, linking cause and effect by patient practice and investigation, and utilizing his every experience, even to the most trivial, everyday occurrence, as a means of obtaining that knowledge of himself which is Understanding, Wisdom, Power. \n\nIn this direction, as in no other, is the law absolute that \"He that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\" for only by patience, practice, and ceaseless importunity can a man enter the Door of the Temple of Knowledge.\n\n- James Allen, As a man thinketh\r\n\t\t\tThink of something lovely you would like to give another. Then ask yourself if you gave it to him and he wouldn't accept it, would you want to keep it for yourself? \n\nIf, for instance, you gave a friend a million dollars and he would not accept it, would you be willing to keep it? I'm sure you would. \n\nThen imagine giving the money to him, then give to others in the same way. You may not even have a bank account; but you can still give, because there is no one to give to but yourself!"

Suggestion of Association, in fact, some consider it to be merely a branch of the latter. \n\nBut we feel that there is a decided difference in the operation of the two phases, and accordingly prefer to treat this one as forming a separate and distinct phase. \n\nOf course, all habit is an association with something in the past, but Suggestion of Habit may arise from an original cause of Suggestion of Authority; Suggestion of Association; Suggestion of Repetition; Suggestion of Imitation; or else from an original decision of the intellect resulting from correct reasoning. \n\nThe former act or thought acts as a suggestive “outside influence,” although it belongs to one’s own mentality.\r\n\t\t\tIV. The Suggestion of Repetition\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Repetition: This form of Suggestion may seem to be very much akin to the preceding phase, i. e. Suggestion of Habit. \n\nBut there is a marked distinction and difference. Suggestion of Habit has its power imparted to it by the habitual repetition of the act or thought on the part of the individual; while Suggestion of Repetition gains its power by the repetition of a Suggestion from some outside object or person. \n\nIt is the constant dripping of water wearing away the stone. \n\nA Suggestion which passes you without much attention or consideration, when first made, will gain both attention and consideration from you if it be repeated sufficiently often, and in the right manner. \r\n\t\t\tV. The Suggestion of Imitation\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Imitation: This form of Suggestion while being in itself a distinct phase of Suggestion, nevertheless has a very close relationship with the several other forms of Suggestion. \n\nIn the acceptance of Suggestion of Authority there is to be found an unconscious imitation of the mental attitude of the person asserting the authority; in Suggestion of Association there is an imitation of the associated thing; and in Suggestion of Repetition there is to be found evidences of imitation. Examples Are found in schools of philosophies, theories, thought and religion.\r\n\t\t\tThe Blending\r\n\t\t\t\tThe phenomena of Suggestion and that of Auto-Suggestion can also blend into each other in subtle degrees. \n\nFor instance, one may receive an impression from outside—an impression which is the effect of a suggestion from outside—and being impressed by it, they may think it over and think and feel about it, so that the idea takes a firm hold upon them. \n\nUp to this point it is Suggestion in its general phase. \n\nBut, then the suggestion is repeated to themselves, both in self-communion and in conversation with others, until an impression is made much deeper than that caused by the original impression. This secondary effect is Auto-Suggestion, of course.",

The Suggestion of Repetition\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Repetition: This form of Suggestion may seem to be very much akin to the preceding phase, i. e. Suggestion of Habit. \n\nBut there is a marked distinction and difference. Suggestion of Habit has its power imparted to it by the habitual repetition of the act or thought on the part of the individual; while Suggestion of Repetition gains its power by the repetition of a Suggestion from some outside object or person. \n\nIt is the constant dripping of water wearing away the stone. \n\nA Suggestion which passes you without much attention or consideration, when first made, will gain both attention and consideration from you if it be repeated sufficiently often, and in the right manner. \r\n\t\t\tV. The Suggestion of Imitation\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Imitation: This form of Suggestion while being in itself a distinct phase of Suggestion, nevertheless has a very close relationship with the several other forms of Suggestion. \n\nIn the acceptance of Suggestion of Authority there is to be found an unconscious imitation of the mental attitude of the person asserting the authority; in Suggestion of Association there is an imitation of the associated thing; and in Suggestion of Repetition there is to be found evidences of imitation. Examples Are found in schools of philosophies, theories, thought and religion.\r\n\t\t\tThe Blending\r\n\t\t\t\tThe phenomena of Suggestion and that of Auto-Suggestion can also blend into each other in subtle degrees. \n\nFor instance, one may receive an impression from outside—an impression which is the effect of a suggestion from outside—and being impressed by it, they may think it over and think and feel about it, so that the idea takes a firm hold upon them. \n\nUp to this point it is Suggestion in its general phase. \n\nBut, then the suggestion is repeated to themselves, both in self-communion and in conversation with others, until an impression is made much deeper than that caused by the original impression. This secondary effect is Auto-Suggestion, of course."

He awakes into a new being, a new man.\r\n\t\tThe new man\r\n\t\t\tNow, the new man is a man of new conversations, as told you in Ephesians \"Put off the former conversations, they belong to the old man that is corrupt, and put on the new man by a transformation of mind\", and the new man is identified with completely new words. He speaks only the kind things; he is incapable of any unlovely thought in the world; he is incapable of even listening to the unlovely for inwardly he speaks only the kind, only the loving things of the world. \r\n\t\t\tThen he finds himself awakening a man within that was asleep; he awakens the second man which is called Christ Jesus in the Bible, which I tell you now is your own wonderful, loving imagination. \r\n\t\t\tWhen imagination awakes it is incapable of being exercised in any way outside of the loving way. So every time you use your imagination lovingly, you are literally awakening this inner man and you're mediating God to man. If I think of anyone in a loving way, I'm in contact with that being and God flows toward him.\r\n\t\t\tYou try it, and you can bless everyone in the world and then eventually the eye opens, the ear opens, the inner man awakes and you see the most glorious world which is always here to be seen, only we in our sleep had shut it out. \r\n\tThe Awakening (I and my father are one)\r\n\t\tThe next life... in this life\r\n\t\t\tWe shut the whole wonderful golden world out by going to sleep and becoming an automaton; but take me seriously for your next life is this life.\r\n\t\t\tYou make this life what you want to make it because if you don't you will find yourself automatically and you won't even know it, because as a sleeping person you don't know you are walking the same track, but if I could only take you within me and let you see with the eye of the inner eye and watch these automatons in the world, sleeping people; yes, the eye is open and they seem to be awake, but they're really sound asleep for they're repeating the same thing.\r\n\t\tAwakened humanity\r\n\t\t\tNow become conscious; as you become conscious you enter the most glorious circle of awakened humanity. I call it the conscious circle of humanity, or as my old teacher used to call it \"The Brothers\".  It simply means the awakened man and when he awakes they're all glorious beings for they are all the image of the Divine One.\r\n\t\t\t So try it, try it today with the art of revision. At the end of this day, review today. If some unlovely thing in the day, don't allow it, you rewrite it. Take that same scene and rewrite it, and having rewritten it replay it. \r\n\t\t\tIn your imagination you imagine the action to be unfolding and you replay everything in the world; as you replay it as you ought to have played it the first time you've changed it. And the moment is never receding as people think, the moment is advancing.\r\n\t\t\tPast/Present/Future = Eternal NOW\r\n\t\t\t\tNow this may seem an insane statement to tell you- -that yesterday is today's future: it seems insane you think it's not, it's past: but by the curvature of time you will discover but you will not know it, because you will be asleep unless you begin to awaken, and you will come upon what is yesteryear in your future, for the moment is never receding, it is always advancing into the future to confront us.\r\n\t\t\t\tAnd so if you don't change it, you will simply find yourself repeating over and over what luckily in God's infinite mercy that sleep shuts out the memory of it, so you are doing it and you think you're doing it for the first time. But I ask you to awake for the purpose of this platform is to awaken everyone who comes here that we may all enter this brotherhood of awakened humanity.\r\n\tThe two gifts\r\n\t\tNow we are told there were 'two gifts given to man at birth'--it doesn't mean this little birth when I left my mother's womb but when I left the womb of my Father that is the grand womb, the womb of creation when, before the world was, He created me and made me perfect and set me in this world for a purpose, educative purpose\r\n\t\tHe gave me two gifts; He gave me His own mind and He gave me the gift of speech, the very thing He used to create a world.

When you say \"I think\" the \"I\" tells the mind what it shall think; when you say \"I go\" the \"I\" tells the physical body where it shall go; the real nature of this \"I\" is spiritual, and is the source of the real power which comes to men and women when they come into a realization of their true nature.\r\n\t\t\t5. The greatest and most marvelous power which this \"I\" has been given is the power to think, but few people know how to think constructively, or correctly, consequently they achieve only indifferent results."

      "text": "The Great Within - Christian D Larson\r\n\tAwaking The Great Within\r\n\t\t1. The subconscious mind is not a second mind; to think so is to place an artificial barrier between the outer person and the limitless within. \n\nThere is but one mind; the outer phase is the conscious or the objective; the inner phase is the subconscious or the subjective.\r\n\t\t2. To awaken the great within is to bring into action the powers and the possibilities that are latent in the subconscious, and since the powers of the within are limitless, and its possibilities numberless, this awakening may be promoted indefinitely.\r\n\t\t3. The strong mind is the mind that is in such close touch with the great within that the limitless powers of the within can be felt at any time. \n\nThe capacity of such a mind will be practically unbounded; weariness will be absent; mental brilliancy will ever be on the increase, and instead of going down with the years, as the average mind does, such a mind will steadily advance in higher attainments and greater achievements the longer the person may live.\r\n\tStimulating the Subconscious\r\n\t\t1.

      "originalText": "The Great Within - Christian D Larson\r\n\tAwaking The Great Within\r\n\t\t1. The subconscious mind is not a second mind; to think so is to place an artificial barrier between the outer person and the limitless within. \n\nThere is but one mind; the outer phase is the conscious or the objective; the inner phase is the subconscious or the subjective.\r\n\t\t2. To awaken the great within is to bring into action the powers and the possibilities that are latent in the subconscious, and since the powers of the within are limitless, and its possibilities numberless, this awakening may be promoted indefinitely.\r\n\t\t3. The strong mind is the mind that is in such close touch with the great within that the limitless powers of the within can be felt at any time. \n\nThe capacity of such a mind will be practically unbounded; weariness will be absent; mental brilliancy will ever be on the increase, and instead of going down with the years, as the average mind does, such a mind will steadily advance in higher attainments and greater achievements the longer the person may live.\r\n\tStimulating the Subconscious\r\n\t\t1. The subconscious should never be forcefully aroused, but should be gradually awakened and developed through such actions of mind as are deep and strong while perfectly serene.\r\n\t\t2.

      "text": "As a Man Thinketh\nJames Allen\r\n\tEffect of Thought on Circumstances\r\n\t\tCircumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. \r\n\t\t\tWhen he begins to reflect upon his condition, and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being is established, he then becomes the wise master, directing his energies with intelligence, and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful issues. \r\n\t\t\tCircumstances, however, are so complicated, thought is so deeply rooted, and the conditions of happiness vary so vastly with individuals, that a man's entire soul condition (although it may be known to himself) cannot be judged by another from the external aspect of his life alone. \r\n\t\t\tAs the progressive and evolving being, man is where he is that he may learn that he may grow; and as he learns the spiritual lesson which any circumstance contains for him, it passes away and gives place to other circumstances. \r\n\t\tA man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.\r\n\t\t\tAct is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry. \r\n\t\t\tBy the right choice and true application of thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the beast. Between these two extremes are all the grades of character, and man is their maker and master. \r\n\t\tNot what he wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns. His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they harmonize with his thoughts and actions. \r\n\t\t\tThe soul attracts that which it secretly harbors; that which it loves, and also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations; it falls to the level of its unchastened desires; and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own. \r\n\t\t\tA man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile, and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his life. And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor, he ceases to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and builds himself up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick against circumstances, but begins to use them as aids to his more rapid progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and possibilities within himself. \r\n\tEffect of Thought on Health and the Body \r\n\t\tChange of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food. \r\n\t\tThe body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the mind, whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically expressed. At the bidding of unlawful thoughts the body sinks rapidly into disease and decay; at the command of glad and beautiful thoughts it becomes clothed with youthfulness and beauty. \r\n\t\t\tStrong, pure, and happy thoughts build up the body in vigor and grace. The body is a delicate and plastic instrument, which responds readily to the thoughts by which it is impressed, and habits of thought will produce their own effects, good or bad, upon it. \r\n\tThought and Purpose \r\n\t\tA man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the centralizing point of his thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, or it may be a worldly object, according to his nature at the time being; but whichever it is, he should steadily focus his thought forces upon the object which he has set before him. He should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote himself to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away into ephemeral fancies, longings, and imaginings.\r\n\t\t\tTo put away aimlessness and weakness, and to begin to think with purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment; who make all conditions serve them, and who think strongly, attempt fearlessly, and accomplish masterfully. \r\n\t\t\tThought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force; he who knows this is ready to become something higher and stronger than a mere bundle of wavering thoughts and fluctuating sensations; he who does this has become the conscious and intelligent wielder of his mental powers. \r\n\t\tThose who are not prepared for the apprehension of a great purpose, should fix their thoughts upon the faultless performance of their duty, no matter how insignificant their task may appear. Only in this way can the thoughts be gathered and focused, and resolution and energy be developed, which being done, there is nothing which may not be accomplished. \r\n\tThe Thought-Factor in Achievement \r\n\t\tThe universe does not favor the greedy, the dishonest, the vicious, although on the mere surface it may sometimes appear to do so; it helps the honest, the magnanimous, the virtuous. All the great Teachers of the ages have declared this in varying forms, and to prove and know it a man has but to persist in making himself more and more virtuous by lifting up his thoughts. \r\n\t\tA strong man cannot help a weaker unless the weaker is willing to be helped, and even then the weak man must become strong of himself; he must, by his own efforts, develop the strength which he admires in another. None but himself can alter his condition. \r\n\t\tHe who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much; he who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly. \r\n\tVisions and Ideals\r\n\t\tThe dreamers are the saviors of the world. As the visible world is sustained by the invisible, so men, through all their trials and sins and sordid vocations, are nourished by the beautiful visions of their solitary dreamers. Humanity cannot forget its dreamers; it cannot let their ideals fade and die; it lives in them; it knows them in the realities which it shall one day see and know. \r\n\t\tCherish your visions; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all heavenly environment; of these, if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built. \r\n\t\tAnd you, too, youthful reader, will realize the Vision (not the idle wish) of your heart, be it base or beautiful, or a mixture of both, for you will always gravitate toward that which you secretly most love.

      "originalText": "As a Man Thinketh\nJames Allen\r\n\tEffect of Thought on Circumstances\r\n\t\tCircumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. \r\n\t\t\tWhen he begins to reflect upon his condition, and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being is established, he then becomes the wise master, directing his energies with intelligence, and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful issues. \r\n\t\t\tCircumstances, however, are so complicated, thought is so deeply rooted, and the conditions of happiness vary so vastly with individuals, that a man's entire soul condition (although it may be known to himself) cannot be judged by another from the external aspect of his life alone. \r\n\t\t\tAs the progressive and evolving being, man is where he is that he may learn that he may grow; and as he learns the spiritual lesson which any circumstance contains for him, it passes away and gives place to other circumstances. \r\n\t\tA man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.\r\n\t\t\tAct is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry. \r\n\t\t\tBy the right choice and true application of thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the beast. Between these two extremes are all the grades of character, and man is their maker and master. \r\n\t\tNot what he wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns. His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they harmonize with his thoughts and actions. \r\n\t\t\tThe soul attracts that which it secretly harbors; that which it loves, and also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations; it falls to the level of its unchastened desires; and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own. \r\n\t\t\tA man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile, and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his life. And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor, he ceases to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and builds himself up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick against circumstances, but begins to use them as aids to his more rapid progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and possibilities within himself. \r\n\tEffect of Thought on Health and the Body \r\n\t\tChange of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food. \r\n\t\tThe body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the mind, whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically expressed. At the bidding of unlawful thoughts the body sinks rapidly into disease and decay; at the command of glad and beautiful thoughts it becomes clothed with youthfulness and beauty. \r\n\t\t\tStrong, pure, and happy thoughts build up the body in vigor and grace. The body is a delicate and plastic instrument, which responds readily to the thoughts by which it is impressed, and habits of thought will produce their own effects, good or bad, upon it. \r\n\tThought and Purpose \r\n\t\tA man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the centralizing point of his thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, or it may be a worldly object, according to his nature at the time being; but whichever it is, he should steadily focus his thought forces upon the object which he has set before him. He should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote himself to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away into ephemeral fancies, longings, and imaginings.\r\n\t\t\tTo put away aimlessness and weakness, and to begin to think with purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment; who make all conditions serve them, and who think strongly, attempt fearlessly, and accomplish masterfully. \r\n\t\t\tThought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force; he who knows this is ready to become something higher and stronger than a mere bundle of wavering thoughts and fluctuating sensations; he who does this has become the conscious and intelligent wielder of his mental powers. \r\n\t\tThose who are not prepared for the apprehension of a great purpose, should fix their thoughts upon the faultless performance of their duty, no matter how insignificant their task may appear. Only in this way can the thoughts be gathered and focused, and resolution and energy be developed, which being done, there is nothing which may not be accomplished. \r\n\tThe Thought-Factor in Achievement \r\n\t\tThe universe does not favor the greedy, the dishonest, the vicious, although on the mere surface it may sometimes appear to do so; it helps the honest, the magnanimous, the virtuous. All the great Teachers of the ages have declared this in varying forms, and to prove and know it a man has but to persist in making himself more and more virtuous by lifting up his thoughts. \r\n\t\tA strong man cannot help a weaker unless the weaker is willing to be helped, and even then the weak man must become strong of himself; he must, by his own efforts, develop the strength which he admires in another. None but himself can alter his condition. \r\n\t\tHe who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much; he who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly. \r\n\tVisions and Ideals\r\n\t\tThe dreamers are the saviors of the world. As the visible world is sustained by the invisible, so men, through all their trials and sins and sordid vocations, are nourished by the beautiful visions of their solitary dreamers. Humanity cannot forget its dreamers; it cannot let their ideals fade and die; it lives in them; it knows them in the realities which it shall one day see and know. \r\n\t\tCherish your visions; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all heavenly environment; of these, if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built. \r\n\t\tAnd you, too, youthful reader, will realize the Vision (not the idle wish) of your heart, be it base or beautiful, or a mixture of both, for you will always gravitate toward that which you secretly most love. Into your hands will be placed the exact results of your own thoughts; you will receive that which you earn; no more, no less. Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain, or rise with your thoughts, your Vision, your Ideal. \r\n\tSerenity\r\n\t\tCalmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of long and patient effort in self control. Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought. \r\n\t\tSelf-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is power. \r\n\t\tThe calm man, having learned how to govern himself, knows how to adapt himself to others; and they, in turn, reverence his spiritual strength, and feel that they can learn of him and rely upon him. The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good. Even the ordinary trader will find his business prosperity increase as he develops a greater self-control and equanimity, for people will always prefer to deal with a man whose demeanor is strongly equable."

In truth, a meek man is a man in complete control of his moods, and his moods are the highest, for he knows he must keep a high mood if he would walk with the highest."

      "text": "Mastery + Psycho-Cybernetics\r\n\tPremise\r\n\t\tSuch feelings can be seen as purely mystical, beyond explanation, or as hallucinations and delusions. \n\nBut there is another way to see them—as eminently real, practical, and explicable. It can be explained in the following way: All of us are born unique. \n\nThis uniqueness is marked genetically in our DNA. We are a one-time phenomenon in the universe—our exact genetic makeup has never occurred before nor will it ever be repeated. \n\nFor all of us, this uniqueness first expresses itself in childhood through certain primal inclinations. \n\nFor Leonardo it was exploring the natural world around his village and bringing it to life on paper in his own way. For others, it can be an early attraction to visual patterns—often an indication of a future interest in mathematics.\n\n Or it can be an attraction to particular physical movements or spatial arrangements. \n\nHow can we explain such inclinations? They are forces within us that come from a deeper place than conscious words can express.\n\nThey draw us to certain experiences and away from others. As these forces move us here or there, they influence the development of our minds in very particular ways. - Robert Greene, Mastery\r\n\tThree-Part Apprenticeship Phase\r\n\t\tKeep in mind that an apprenticeship can come in many different forms. \n\nIt can happen at one place over several years, or it can consist of several different positions in different places, a kind of compound apprenticeship involving many different skills. \n\nIt can include a mix of graduate school and practical experience. \n\nIn all of these cases, it will help you to think in terms of these steps, although you may need to give added weight to a particular one depending on the nature of your field.\r\n\t\t1. Deep Observation\r\n\t\t\tEvery task you are given, no matter how menial, offers opportunities to observe this world at work. \n\nNo detail about the people within it is too trivial. Everything you see or hear is a sign for you to decode. \n\nOver time, you will begin to see and understand more of the reality that eluded you at first.\r\n\t\t2. Skills Acquisition\r\n\t\t\tIn essence, when you practice and develop any skill you transform yourself in the process. \n\nYou reveal to yourself new capabilities that were previously latent, that are exposed as you progress.\r\n\t\t3. Experimentation\r\n\t\t\tAs you gain in skill and confidence, you must make the move to a more active mode of experimentation.\r\n\t\t\tThe future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.\r\n\t\tPsycho-Cybernetics Integration \r\n\t\t\tThe Answer Exists Now In much the same way, when we set out to find a new idea, or the answer to a problem, we must assume that the answer exists already— somewhere, and set out to find it.\r\n\t\t\t\t1. Your built-in success mechanism must have a goal or \"target.\" This goal, or target, must be conceived of as \"already in existence—now\" either in actual or potential form.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. The automatic mechanism is teleological, that is, operates, or must be oriented to \"end results,\" goals. \n\nDo not be discouraged because the \"means whereby\" may not be apparent. \n\nIt is the function of the automatic mechanism to supply the \"means whereby\" when you supply the goal. \n\nThink in terms of the end result, and the means whereby will often take care of themselves.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Do not be afraid of making mistakes, or of temporary failures. \n\nAll servo-mechanisms achieve a goal by negative feedback, or by going forward, making mistakes, and immediately correcting course.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Skill learning of any kind is accomplished by trial and error, mentally correcting aim after an error, until a \"successful\" motion, movement or performance has been achieved. \n\nAfter that, further learning, and continued success, is accomplished by forgetting the past 'errors, and remembering the successful response, so that it can be \"imitated.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t5. You must learn to trust your creative mechanism to do its work and not \"jam it\" by becoming too concerned or too anxious as to whether it will work or not, or by attempting to force it by too much conscious effort.\n\nYou must \"let it\" work, rather than \"make it\" work.",

We are a one-time phenomenon in the universe—our exact genetic makeup has never occurred before nor will it ever be repeated. \n\nFor all of us, this uniqueness first expresses itself in childhood through certain primal inclinations. \n\nFor Leonardo it was exploring the natural world around his village and bringing it to life on paper in his own way. For others, it can be an early attraction to visual patterns—often an indication of a future interest in mathematics.\n\n Or it can be an attraction to particular physical movements or spatial arrangements. \n\nHow can we explain such inclinations? They are forces within us that come from a deeper place than conscious words can express.\n\nThey draw us to certain experiences and away from others. As these forces move us here or there, they influence the development of our minds in very particular ways. - Robert Greene, Mastery\r\n\tThree-Part Apprenticeship Phase\r\n\t\tKeep in mind that an apprenticeship can come in many different forms. \n\nIt can happen at one place over several years, or it can consist of several different positions in different places, a kind of compound apprenticeship involving many different skills. \n\nIt can include a mix of graduate school and practical experience. \n\nIn all of these cases, it will help you to think in terms of these steps, although you may need to give added weight to a particular one depending on the nature of your field.\r\n\t\t1. Deep Observation\r\n\t\t\tEvery task you are given, no matter how menial, offers opportunities to observe this world at work. \n\nNo detail about the people within it is too trivial. Everything you see or hear is a sign for you to decode. \n\nOver time, you will begin to see and understand more of the reality that eluded you at first.\r\n\t\t2. Skills Acquisition\r\n\t\t\tIn essence, when you practice and develop any skill you transform yourself in the process. \n\nYou reveal to yourself new capabilities that were previously latent, that are exposed as you progress.\r\n\t\t3. Experimentation\r\n\t\t\tAs you gain in skill and confidence, you must make the move to a more active mode of experimentation.\r\n\t\t\tThe future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.\r\n\t\tPsycho-Cybernetics Integration \r\n\t\t\tThe Answer Exists Now In much the same way, when we set out to find a new idea, or the answer to a problem, we must assume that the answer exists already— somewhere, and set out to find it.\r\n\t\t\t\t1. Your built-in success mechanism must have a goal or \"target.\" This goal, or target, must be conceived of as \"already in existence—now\" either in actual or potential form.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. The automatic mechanism is teleological, that is, operates, or must be oriented to \"end results,\" goals. \n\nDo not be discouraged because the \"means whereby\" may not be apparent. \n\nIt is the function of the automatic mechanism to supply the \"means whereby\" when you supply the goal. \n\nThink in terms of the end result, and the means whereby will often take care of themselves.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Do not be afraid of making mistakes, or of temporary failures. \n\nAll servo-mechanisms achieve a goal by negative feedback, or by going forward, making mistakes, and immediately correcting course.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Skill learning of any kind is accomplished by trial and error, mentally correcting aim after an error, until a \"successful\" motion, movement or performance has been achieved. \n\nAfter that, further learning, and continued success, is accomplished by forgetting the past 'errors, and remembering the successful response, so that it can be \"imitated.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t5. You must learn to trust your creative mechanism to do its work and not \"jam it\" by becoming too concerned or too anxious as to whether it will work or not, or by attempting to force it by too much conscious effort.\n\nYou must \"let it\" work, rather than \"make it\" work."

Mind evolves ideas, and ideas express themselves through thoughts and words. \n\nUnderstanding that ideas have a permanent existence and that they evolve thoughts and words, we see how futile is any attempted reform that does not take them into consideration.\r\n\t\tIdeas generate thought currents, as a fire under a boiler generates steam. The idea is the most important factor in every act and must be given first place in our attention if we would bring about any results of a permanent character.\r\n\t\tIdeas are centers of consciousness. They have a positive and a negative pole and generate thoughts of every conceivable kind. Hence a man’s body, health, intelligence, finances, in fact everything about him, are derived from the ideas to which he gives his attention.\r\n\tAll is mind\r\n\t\tAll is mind. Then the things that appear must be expressions of mind. Thus mind is reality, and it also appears as phenomena. The is-ness of mind is but one side of it. Being is not limited to the level of is-ness; it has all possibilities, including that of breaking forth from its inherencies into the realm of appearances. \n\nMind has these two sides, being and appearance, the visible and the invisible. To say that mind is all and yet deny that things do appear to have any place in the allness is to state but half the truth.\r\n\t\t\tEverything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.\n\n -The Kybalion\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that the difference between things seemingly diametrically opposed to each other is merely a matter of degree. \n\nIt teaches that \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled,\" and that \"thesis and anti-thesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; and that the \"universal reconciliation of opposites\" is effected by a recognition of this Principle of Polarity. \n\nThe teachers claim that illustrations of this Principle may be had on every hand, and from an examination into the real nature of anything. They begin by showing that Spirit and Matter are but the two poles of the same thing, the intermediate planes being merely degrees of vibration. \n\nThey show that THE ALL and The Many are the same, the difference being merely a matter of degree of Mental Manifestation. Thus the LAW\n\n -The Kybalion\r\n\t\t\t\tThen passing on to the Physical Plane, they illustrate the Principle by showing that Heat and Cold are identical in nature, the differences being merely a matter of degrees. \n\nThe thermometer shows many degrees of temperature, the lowest pole being called \"cold,\" and the highest \"heat.\" Between these two poles are many degrees of \"heat\" or \"cold,\" call them either and you are equally correct. \n\nThe higher of two degrees is always \"warmer,\" while the lower is always \"colder.\" There is no absolute standard-all is a matter of degree. There is no place on the thermometer where heat ceases and cold begins.\n\n -The Kybalion\r\n\t\t\t\tA knowledge of the existence of this great Hermetic Principle will enable the student to better understand his own mental states, and those of other people. \n\nHe will see that these states are all matters of degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration at will--to change his mental poles, and thus be Master of his mental states, instead of being their servant and slave. \n\nAnd by his knowledge he will be able to aid his fellows intelligently and by the appropriate methods change the polarity when the same is desirable. We advise all students to familiarize themselves with this Principle of Polarity, for a correct understanding of the same will throw light on many difficult subjects.\n\n -The Kybalion\r\n\t\tDwelling in the idea\r\n\t\t\tYou will find that your ideas have broadened immensely, that your little limited world has been transformed into a big world. \n\nYou will find your mind more alert and you will see clearly where you were in doubt before, because you have begun thinking about realities instead of appearances. \n\nThe consciousness of an omnipotent hand guiding all your affairs will establish you in confidence and security, which will extend to the body welfare and surroundings. There will be a lessening or entire absence of prejudice and faultfinding in you. \n\nYou will be more forgiving and more generous and will not judge harshly. \n\nOther people will feel that there has been a change in you and will appreciate you more, showing it in many ways. Things will be coming your way, being added unto you indeed according to the promise.\r\n\t\t\tDo not expect miracles to be performed for you, but do expect the law with which you have identified yourself to work out your problem by means of the latent possibilities in and around you. Above all, be yourself. Let the God within you express Himself through you in the world without.\r\n\t\t\tCharge your mind with statements that express plenty. No particular affirmation will raise anyone from poverty to affluence, yet all affirmations that carry ideas of abundance will lead one into the consciousness that fulfills the law. \n\nDeny that lack has any place or reality in your thought or your affairs and affirm plenty as the only appearance. Praise what you have, be it ever so little, and insist that it is constantly growing larger.",

Hence a man’s body, health, intelligence, finances, in fact everything about him, are derived from the ideas to which he gives his attention.\r\n\tAll is mind\r\n\t\tAll is mind. Then the things that appear must be expressions of mind. Thus mind is reality, and it also appears as phenomena. The is-ness of mind is but one side of it. Being is not limited to the level of is-ness; it has all possibilities, including that of breaking forth from its inherencies into the realm of appearances. \n\nMind has these two sides, being and appearance, the visible and the invisible. To say that mind is all and yet deny that things do appear to have any place in the allness is to state but half the truth.\r\n\t\t\tEverything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.\n\n -The Kybalion\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that the difference between things seemingly diametrically opposed to each other is merely a matter of degree. \n\nIt teaches that \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled,\" and that \"thesis and anti-thesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; and that the \"universal reconciliation of opposites\" is effected by a recognition of this Principle of Polarity. \n\nThe teachers claim that illustrations of this Principle may be had on every hand, and from an examination into the real nature of anything. They begin by showing that Spirit and Matter are but the two poles of the same thing, the intermediate planes being merely degrees of vibration. \n\nThey show that THE ALL and The Many are the same, the difference being merely a matter of degree of Mental Manifestation. Thus the LAW\n\n -The Kybalion\r\n\t\t\t\tThen passing on to the Physical Plane, they illustrate the Principle by showing that Heat and Cold are identical in nature, the differences being merely a matter of degrees. \n\nThe thermometer shows many degrees of temperature, the lowest pole being called \"cold,\" and the highest \"heat.\" Between these two poles are many degrees of \"heat\" or \"cold,\" call them either and you are equally correct. \n\nThe higher of two degrees is always \"warmer,\" while the lower is always \"colder.\" There is no absolute standard-all is a matter of degree. There is no place on the thermometer where heat ceases and cold begins.\n\n -The Kybalion\r\n\t\t\t\tA knowledge of the existence of this great Hermetic Principle will enable the student to better understand his own mental states, and those of other people. \n\nHe will see that these states are all matters of degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration at will--to change his mental poles, and thus be Master of his mental states, instead of being their servant and slave. \n\nAnd by his knowledge he will be able to aid his fellows intelligently and by the appropriate methods change the polarity when the same is desirable. We advise all students to familiarize themselves with this Principle of Polarity, for a correct understanding of the same will throw light on many difficult subjects.\n\n -The Kybalion\r\n\t\tDwelling in the idea\r\n\t\t\tYou will find that your ideas have broadened immensely, that your little limited world has been transformed into a big world. \n\nYou will find your mind more alert and you will see clearly where you were in doubt before, because you have begun thinking about realities instead of appearances. \n\nThe consciousness of an omnipotent hand guiding all your affairs will establish you in confidence and security, which will extend to the body welfare and surroundings. There will be a lessening or entire absence of prejudice and faultfinding in you. \n\nYou will be more forgiving and more generous and will not judge harshly. \n\nOther people will feel that there has been a change in you and will appreciate you more, showing it in many ways. Things will be coming your way, being added unto you indeed according to the promise.\r\n\t\t\tDo not expect miracles to be performed for you, but do expect the law with which you have identified yourself to work out your problem by means of the latent possibilities in and around you. Above all, be yourself. Let the God within you express Himself through you in the world without.\r\n\t\t\tCharge your mind with statements that express plenty. No particular affirmation will raise anyone from poverty to affluence, yet all affirmations that carry ideas of abundance will lead one into the consciousness that fulfills the law. \n\nDeny that lack has any place or reality in your thought or your affairs and affirm plenty as the only appearance. Praise what you have, be it ever so little, and insist that it is constantly growing larger."

      "text": "The Magic Of Believing\nClaude Bristol\r\n\tBeliefs\r\n\t\t\"Consider that everything is opinion, \nand opinion is in thy power” - Marcus Aurelius.\r\n\t\t\tCharms, amulets, and talismans have no power in\nthemselves. But those who believe in them firmly and unquestionably tend\nto develop the kind of force or power now known as psychokinetic.\r\n\t\t\tA cracked or broken mirror isn’t going to bring you bad luck unless you\nbelieve in it. But as long as the belief is fertilized, nurtured, and made a\npart of your inner self, believe it or not, it is going to bring you bad luck –\nbecause the subconscious mind always brings to reality what it is led to\nbelieve.\r\n\t\t\tLet me interpose a word of caution. This experiment, as well as others\noutlined in this book, should never be attempted in the presence of scoffers\nor those who profess disbelief in psychic phenomena. Their negative\nthoughts may confuse and obstruct the free flow of your own, especially if\ntheir skepticism is aggressive.\r\n\t\tThe act of believing is the starting force, the\ngenerating power that leads to accomplishment.\r\n\t\tI must point out, though, that it is easy to lose one’s belief or faith. Thousands have risen to great heights of success, only to stumble and fall to undreamed-of depths. Others, seeking health,\nhave appeared to be more or less miraculously cured, only to find that their ailments recur years or even months later. There are many weakening factors and influences – all suggestive in nature – which, in unguarded moments, we allow to slip into our subconscious minds. Once there, they\nbegin their destructive work and undo all the good our constructive forces accomplished.\r\n\t\tBelief changes the tempo of the mind or thought frequency.\nLike a huge magnet, it draws the subconscious forces into play,\nchanging your whole aura and affecting everything about you – including\npeople and objects at great distances. It often brings into your individual\nsphere of life results that are sometimes startling – results you never\ndreamed possible.\r\n\t\tMost sustained and continuing manifestations come as a\nresult of deep-seated belief. Through this belief, with its strange power,\nmiracles happen and peculiar phenomena occur for which there appears to\nbe no known explanation.\r\n\tConscious mind & Subconscious mind \r\n\t\tConscious mind\r\n\t\t\tThe conscious mind is the source of thought. Also, it gives us the\nsense of awareness in our normal waking life; the knowledge that we are\nourselves here and now; the recognition and understanding of our\nenvironment; the power to rule over our mental faculties, to recall the\nevents of our past life, and to comprehend our emotions and their\nsignificance. More concretely, it enables us to have a rational\nunderstanding of the objects and persons about us, of our own successes or shortcomings, of the validity of an argument, or the beauty of a work of art.\r\n\t\t\tI realize it’s difficult for the average person who knows nothing of this\nsubject to accept the idea that all is within. But even as far as the most\nmaterialistic person is concerned, nothing exists for them unless they have\nknowledge of it or unless it becomes fixed in their consciousness. The\nimages created in their mind give reality to the world outside of them.\nTherefore happiness, sought by many and found by few, is a matter entirely\nwithin ourselves. Your environment and the everyday happenings of life\nhave absolutely no effect on your happiness except as you permit mental\nimages of the outside to enter your consciousness. Happiness is wholly\nindependent of position, wealth, or material possessions. It is a state of\nmind which we ourselves have the power to control – and that control lies\nwith our thinking.\r\n\t\t\tThoughts\r\n\t\t\t\tThought is the original source of all wealth, all success, all material gain,\nall great discoveries and inventions, and of all achievement. Without it\nthere would be no medicine, no great museums, no great plays or novels, no\nmodern conveniences – in fact, there would be no advance over life in the\nmost primitive ages.\r\n\t\t\t\tTherefore, it is vital that you know exactly what you want out of life.\nYou must know where you are headed, and keep a fixed goal in view. That,\nof course, is the overall picture; it makes no difference whether you want a\njob or a better one, a new house, a place in the country, or just a new pair of\nshoes. You must have a fixed idea before you’ll obtain what you are after.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe subconscious comes to the aid of those in the habit of making\nquick decisions almost instantaneously, and it comes into operation when\nyou have cleared your conscious mind of its multitude of conflicting\nthoughts.\r\n\t\t\t\tDesire for something new, something different, that is going to change your life, makes you exert\nan extra effort.\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat may appear as coincidences are not coincidences at all, but\nsimply the working out of the pattern which you started with your own\nweaving.\r\n\t\t\t\tLiving here in the hills away from people and everyday influences, I\nhave often felt that those who live close to nature were in a much better\nposition to utilize the subconscious than others.\r\n\t\t\t\tCompare your mind to a tank filled to the brim with clear,\npure water. You cannot put any object into that tank without displacing\nsome of the water and causing the tank to overflow.\nWhen you permit negative thoughts of doubt or fear to enter your\nconsciousness, obviously some of your forceful, positive, creative thoughts\nwill have to give way, and consequently you weaken your positive state.\nThus, as long as you do not accept unfavorable vibrations, your\nsubconscious mind will not be hindered by anything you may hear, see, or\nexperience.\r\n\t\tSubconscious mind\r\n\t\t\tJust as the conscious mind is the source of thought, so the subconscious\nis the source of power. Rooted in instinct, it is aware of the individual’s\nmost elemental desires, and it is always pressing upward into conscious\nexistence. It is a repository of spontaneous impressions of man and nature,\nand a memory vault in which are kept the records of facts and experiences\nsent down to it from time to time by the conscious mind for safekeeping\nand future use.\r\n\t\t\tEvery student of the subject knows what may be accomplished by\ngetting into direct contact with the subconscious mind – thousands have\nemployed it to achieve wealth, power, and fame in this world, as well as to\ncure physical ailments and solve countless human problems. And its\npower is there for you to use. The only steps you have to take are to believe\nin its power and use the technique set forth in this book – or else devise a\nsystem of your own that will put it to work for you.\r\n\t\t\tThe subconscious mind is beyond space and time, and is fundamentally\na powerful sending and receiving station with a universal hookup. It can\ncommunicate with the physical, mental, psychic, and – according to many\ninvestigators – spiritual worlds.\r\n\t\t\tAlways remember that the subconscious mind, besides being the seat of\nintuition, is a repository of great power and inexhaustible resources. The\nmore you call upon these resources the more are placed at your disposal.\nRemember also: the subconscious is ageless. It can never grow old or tired,\nand you can draw upon it all your life. The only thing you need is the\npower of believing – sincerely, strongly, and completely. Once the\nsubconscious receives your message and understands your desires and\nambitions, it will be only a short time before your desire will be fulfilled\nand your ambition achieved.\r\n\t\t\tSometimes your thought is concerned with trying to solve a\ndifficult problem, and you have become so exhausted and discouraged at\nfailing to arrive at a solution that you “give it up,” “let the whole thing go,”\n“dismiss it from your mind,” an action you often take at night when you can’t sleep because of the thought that is pounding and gripping your\nbrain. The moment you let it go, it begins to sink, as though it were\nmoving downward somewhere inside of you. The tension in your\nconscious mind then decreases and you are soon asleep. The next morning\nwhen you wake up, your conscious mind begins to think again about the\nproblem, when suddenly there appears before your mind’s eyes a mental\npicture of the complete solution, with all the necessary directions for\nappropriate action on your part.\r\n\t\t\tThree primary functions \nof your subconscious mind\r\n\t\t\t\tIntuitive understanding of the bodily needs, it maintains and preserves\n(unaided by the conscious mind) the well-being and indeed the very life of\nthe physical body\r\n\t\t\t\tin times of great emergency it springs into immediate action (again independently of\nthe conscious mind) and takes supreme command, acting with incredible\ncertitude, rapidity, accuracy, and understanding.\r\n\t\t\t\tIt is operative in the psychic world. The psychic powers of the subconscious are manifested\nin such phenomena as telepathy, clairvoyance, and psychokinesis. But,\nalso, it can be summoned to help the conscious mind in time of great\npersonal necessity, when the conscious calls upon the subconscious to use\nits powers and resources to solve a vital problem or bring to pass whatever\nthe individual seeks or desires.\r\n\t\t\t\tHow to program your subconscious mind\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSuggestion is Power\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is dormant in each human being a faculty, whether developed or\nnot, which will enable that particular individual to succeed if the desire for\nsuccess is present in his conscious mind.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMen and women with strong personal magnetism and great\norators can get the same emotional effect without props or stage settings to\naid them. They are masters of tone effects, emotional appeal,\ngesticulations, bodily movements, eye magnetism, etc., by which your\nattention is held and you yourself are thrown wide open to their driving\nappeal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRepetition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThrough repetition, the person with a fixed goal, a clear picture of their desire, or ideal always before them causes it to be buried deeply in their\nsubconscious mind and thus – thanks to its generative and sustaining\npower – realizes their goal in a minimum of time and with a minimum of\nphysical effort. Just pursue the thought unceasingly. Step by step you will\nachieve realization, for all your faculties and powers become directed to\nthat end.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn all religions, cults, and orders, there is an obvious, prescribed ritual in\nwhich the repetition of words (mystical or otherwise) plays an important\npart. And this brings us to the law of suggestion. Forces operating within\nits limits are capable of producing phenomenal results. That is, the power\nof suggestion – either autosuggestion (your own to yourself) or\nheterosuggestion (coming to you from outside sources) – starts the machinery into operation, causing the subconscious mind to begin its\ncreative work – and right here is where the affirmations and repetitions\nplay their part.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStrange as it may sound, we usually get what we anticipate. And if you\nanticipate increasing your sales and believe that you are going to do it, your\nsales will mount just as though some invisible friend were helping out. The\nidea of anticipation holds in everything we do.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRepetition of the same chant, the same incantations, the\nsame affirmations leads to belief, and once that belief becomes a deep\nconviction, things begin to happen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgain we see the terrific force of thought repetition – it is our master,\nand we do as we are ordered. This subtle force of the repeated suggestion\novercomes our reason, acting directly on our emotions and our feelings,\nfinally penetrating to the very depths of our subconscious minds. This is\nthe basic principle of all successful advertising – the continued and\nrepeated suggestion that first makes you believe, after which you are eager\nto buy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMany people become confused and frustrated because they let\nthemselves be influenced by others’ negative thoughts. This is a weakness\nof many salesmen, when they absorb too much of what the prospect says\nabout his reasons for not buying. Repetition of negative thoughts, if\ncontinued long enough, will discourage even the most powerful. Unless\nyour mind is closed against them and you counteract them by constantly\nthinking and radiating positive thoughts, sooner or later you will find\nyourself sunk.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome people wear themselves out trying to combat negative forces by superhuman effort and sheer will power, never realizing that\ntheir own minds, operating in accordance with the suggestive influences,\nare causing all the trouble.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhether we know it or not, we are all victims of suggestion – in many\ncases almost to the point of being hypnotized. We follow along a beaten\npath of living just because we’ve been doing it for decades.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Mirror Technique\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMany great orators, preachers, actors, and statesmen have used the\nmirror technique. According to Drew Pearson, Winston Churchill never\nmade a speech of importance unless he made it before a mirror first.\nPearson also declared that Woodrow Wilson employed the same\ntechnique. It’s what I call a supercharging method of stepping up the\nspeaker’s subconscious forces so that when he or she appears before an\naudience, those forces flow out also and affect the listeners. By using the\nmirror in rehearsing the speech as you are going to deliver it, you are\ncreating a picture of yourself, your words, the sound of your voice, and your\nsight of the audience, to which the immediate future is to bring reality. By\nlooking into the mirror, you increase the mental vibrations by which the\nforce and meaning of your words will quickly penetrate to your audience’s\nsubconscious minds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow to outline the technique.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStand in front of a mirror. It need not be full-length, but it should be\nlarge enough so that you can at least see your body from the waist up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow breathe deeply three\nor four times until you feel a sense of power, strength, and determination.\nNext, look into the very depths of your eyes, tell yourself that you are going\nto get what you want – name it aloud so you can see your lips move and\nhear the words uttered.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour eyes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMuch has been written about the power of the eyes. The eyes are said\nto be the windows of the soul; they reveal your thoughts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou will find, however, that once you start this mirror\npractice, your eyes will take on a power that you never realized you could\ndevelop\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis will give you that penetrating gaze that makes\nothers think you are looking into their very souls. Sooner or later will come\nan intensity to bespeak the intensity of your thought, which people will\nbegin to recognize.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMake a regular ritual of it, practice doing it at least twice a day,\nmornings and evenings – and you will be surprised at the results.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe revealing nature of your thoughts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake the initiative. Always try to do something for the other fellow,\nand you will be agreeably surprised how things come your way, how many\npleasant things are done for you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis brings me to another point – a person who desires riches must go\nwhere riches are.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe vibrations set up by others affect us much more than we realize, for\nwe take on the characteristics of those with whom we associate more or\nless constantly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo better understand the effect of these suggestive vibrations, you need\nonly remember your varying feelings upon entering different offices or\nhomes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe very way you walk, the way you carry yourself, your talk, your\nmanner of dress, all reflect your way of thinking. A slovenly carriage is an\nindication of slovenly thinking, whereas an alert, upright carriage is the\noutward sign of inward strength and confidence. What you exhibit\noutwardly, you are inwardly. You are the product of your own thoughts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI cannot emphasize too strongly that you should tell no one just what\nthe words on the cards mean, nor give anyone an inkling of what you\ndesire. To do so may end disastrously for you. When you get a better understanding of this science, you can understand how thought vibrations\n– conscious or unconscious, because of envy or some other cause – can be\nset up to counteract your own.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to draw upon the resources and powers of the \nsubconscious and awaken it into action\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin conveying your need to the subconscious, it must be\nin images of the work having already been done. Thus, while it is necessary\nfor you to feel and think yourself successful, it is important to go one step\nfurther and actually see yourself as already successful, either in the\nperformance of some selected task or as actually occupying the position to\nwhich you aspire.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Art Of Mental Pictures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerhaps the most effective method of bringing the subconscious into\npractical play is through making mental pictures. Use your imagination to\nperfect an image of the thing or situation as you would like it to exist in\nphysical form. This is usually referred to as visualization.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is pretty well agreed that the subconscious mind works as a result of\nimages thrown upon its screen, but if there is something wrong with your\nprojection apparatus or the original slide, then the projected image is\nblurred, inverted, or a total blank. Doubts, fears, counter-thoughts, all\nmanage to blur the pictures you consciously desire to project.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is very important to remember that the subconscious will go into action at once under the impetus of the commands or suggestions it\nreceives from the conscious mind (or which come from outside sources and\nare transmitted to it via the conscious mind). But it gets results quicker if\nthe conscious mind accompanies its message with a mental picture of the\ndesired goal. It may be faint, sketchy, or even unfinished, but even if only\nan outline, it will be enough for the subconscious to act upon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou must wait patiently\nwhile the subconscious assimilates the elements of your problem and then\ngoes about its own way to work it out for you. You must have patience and\nabsolute faith, for, as Theodore Simon Jouffroy, the French philosopher,\nsaid, “The subconscious mind will not take the trouble to work for those\nwho do not believe in it.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn due course, with the flowing of the ideas and plans of the\nsubconscious into your waiting conscious mind, the solution of your\nproblem will be revealed to you and the correct course of action indicated.\nYou must receive the message from the subconscious freely, and after\nunderstanding it you must act at once, immediately and unquestioningly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere must be no hesitation on your part, no mental reservation, no\ndeliberation. Only by a prompt and automatic response will you make\nyour subconscious continue to respond whenever you call upon it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYour problem may be one that cannot be solved in this\nmanner Instead of receiving the solution in the form of a “blueprint” to\nguide your steps to the final fulfillment, at intervals you may feel some\nmysterious force urging you to do certain things that seem to have no\nspecial significance or logical connection. Nevertheless, you must continue\nto believe in the power and wisdom of the subconscious. Obediently\nperform the seemingly irrelevant things, and one day you will find yourself\nin the position you sought, doing the work you envisioned for yourself.\nThen, when you look back, you will see how the things you were called\nupon to do, through the aid of the subconscious, all formed a logical line of\nevents, the last one of which was your final arriving – the reward of your\nsincerest hopes and desires, your own triumphant personal success!",

But those who believe in them firmly and unquestionably tend\nto develop the kind of force or power now known as psychokinetic.\r\n\t\t\tA cracked or broken mirror isn’t going to bring you bad luck unless you\nbelieve in it. But as long as the belief is fertilized, nurtured, and made a\npart of your inner self, believe it or not, it is going to bring you bad luck –\nbecause the subconscious mind always brings to reality what it is led to\nbelieve.\r\n\t\t\tLet me interpose a word of caution. This experiment, as well as others\noutlined in this book, should never be attempted in the presence of scoffers\nor those who profess disbelief in psychic phenomena. Their negative\nthoughts may confuse and obstruct the free flow of your own, especially if\ntheir skepticism is aggressive.\r\n\t\tThe act of believing is the starting force, the\ngenerating power that leads to accomplishment.\r\n\t\tI must point out, though, that it is easy to lose one’s belief or faith. Thousands have risen to great heights of success, only to stumble and fall to undreamed-of depths. Others, seeking health,\nhave appeared to be more or less miraculously cured, only to find that their ailments recur years or even months later. There are many weakening factors and influences – all suggestive in nature – which, in unguarded moments, we allow to slip into our subconscious minds. Once there, they\nbegin their destructive work and undo all the good our constructive forces accomplished.\r\n\t\tBelief changes the tempo of the mind or thought frequency.\nLike a huge magnet, it draws the subconscious forces into play,\nchanging your whole aura and affecting everything about you – including\npeople and objects at great distances. It often brings into your individual\nsphere of life results that are sometimes startling – results you never\ndreamed possible.\r\n\t\tMost sustained and continuing manifestations come as a\nresult of deep-seated belief. Through this belief, with its strange power,\nmiracles happen and peculiar phenomena occur for which there appears to\nbe no known explanation.\r\n\tConscious mind & Subconscious mind \r\n\t\tConscious mind\r\n\t\t\tThe conscious mind is the source of thought. Also, it gives us the\nsense of awareness in our normal waking life; the knowledge that we are\nourselves here and now; the recognition and understanding of our\nenvironment; the power to rule over our mental faculties, to recall the\nevents of our past life, and to comprehend our emotions and their\nsignificance. More concretely, it enables us to have a rational\nunderstanding of the objects and persons about us, of our own successes or shortcomings, of the validity of an argument, or the beauty of a work of art.\r\n\t\t\tI realize it’s difficult for the average person who knows nothing of this\nsubject to accept the idea that all is within.

By\nlooking into the mirror, you increase the mental vibrations by which the\nforce and meaning of your words will quickly penetrate to your audience’s\nsubconscious minds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow to outline the technique.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStand in front of a mirror. It need not be full-length, but it should be\nlarge enough so that you can at least see your body from the waist up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow breathe deeply three\nor four times until you feel a sense of power, strength, and determination.\nNext, look into the very depths of your eyes, tell yourself that you are going\nto get what you want – name it aloud so you can see your lips move and\nhear the words uttered.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour eyes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMuch has been written about the power of the eyes. The eyes are said\nto be the windows of the soul; they reveal your thoughts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou will find, however, that once you start this mirror\npractice, your eyes will take on a power that you never realized you could\ndevelop\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis will give you that penetrating gaze that makes\nothers think you are looking into their very souls. Sooner or later will come\nan intensity to bespeak the intensity of your thought, which people will\nbegin to recognize.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMake a regular ritual of it, practice doing it at least twice a day,\nmornings and evenings – and you will be surprised at the results.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe revealing nature of your thoughts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake the initiative. Always try to do something for the other fellow,\nand you will be agreeably surprised how things come your way, how many\npleasant things are done for you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis brings me to another point – a person who desires riches must go\nwhere riches are.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe vibrations set up by others affect us much more than we realize, for\nwe take on the characteristics of those with whom we associate more or\nless constantly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo better understand the effect of these suggestive vibrations, you need\nonly remember your varying feelings upon entering different offices or\nhomes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe very way you walk, the way you carry yourself, your talk, your\nmanner of dress, all reflect your way of thinking. A slovenly carriage is an\nindication of slovenly thinking, whereas an alert, upright carriage is the\noutward sign of inward strength and confidence. What you exhibit\noutwardly, you are inwardly. You are the product of your own thoughts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI cannot emphasize too strongly that you should tell no one just what\nthe words on the cards mean, nor give anyone an inkling of what you\ndesire. To do so may end disastrously for you. When you get a better understanding of this science, you can understand how thought vibrations\n– conscious or unconscious, because of envy or some other cause – can be\nset up to counteract your own.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to draw upon the resources and powers of the \nsubconscious and awaken it into action\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin conveying your need to the subconscious, it must be\nin images of the work having already been done. Thus, while it is necessary\nfor you to feel and think yourself successful, it is important to go one step\nfurther and actually see yourself as already successful, either in the\nperformance of some selected task or as actually occupying the position to\nwhich you aspire.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Art Of Mental Pictures\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerhaps the most effective method of bringing the subconscious into\npractical play is through making mental pictures. Use your imagination to\nperfect an image of the thing or situation as you would like it to exist in\nphysical form. This is usually referred to as visualization.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is pretty well agreed that the subconscious mind works as a result of\nimages thrown upon its screen, but if there is something wrong with your\nprojection apparatus or the original slide, then the projected image is\nblurred, inverted, or a total blank. Doubts, fears, counter-thoughts, all\nmanage to blur the pictures you consciously desire to project.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is very important to remember that the subconscious will go into action at once under the impetus of the commands or suggestions it\nreceives from the conscious mind (or which come from outside sources and\nare transmitted to it via the conscious mind). But it gets results quicker if\nthe conscious mind accompanies its message with a mental picture of the\ndesired goal. It may be faint, sketchy, or even unfinished, but even if only\nan outline, it will be enough for the subconscious to act upon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou must wait patiently\nwhile the subconscious assimilates the elements of your problem and then\ngoes about its own way to work it out for you. You must have patience and\nabsolute faith, for, as Theodore Simon Jouffroy, the French philosopher,\nsaid, “The subconscious mind will not take the trouble to work for those\nwho do not believe in it.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn due course, with the flowing of the ideas and plans of the\nsubconscious into your waiting conscious mind, the solution of your\nproblem will be revealed to you and the correct course of action indicated.\nYou must receive the message from the subconscious freely, and after\nunderstanding it you must act at once, immediately and unquestioningly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere must be no hesitation on your part, no mental reservation, no\ndeliberation. Only by a prompt and automatic response will you make\nyour subconscious continue to respond whenever you call upon it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYour problem may be one that cannot be solved in this\nmanner Instead of receiving the solution in the form of a “blueprint” to\nguide your steps to the final fulfillment, at intervals you may feel some\nmysterious force urging you to do certain things that seem to have no\nspecial significance or logical connection. Nevertheless, you must continue\nto believe in the power and wisdom of the subconscious. Obediently\nperform the seemingly irrelevant things, and one day you will find yourself\nin the position you sought, doing the work you envisioned for yourself.\nThen, when you look back, you will see how the things you were called\nupon to do, through the aid of the subconscious, all formed a logical line of\nevents, the last one of which was your final arriving – the reward of your\nsincerest hopes and desires, your own triumphant personal success!"

One of the dictionaries defines this sense of the term as follows:\n\n“To introduce indirectly into the mind or thoughts.” And, later, psychologists began to use the term in a still broader sense, i. e. that of the impression upon the mind by the agency of other objects, such as gesture, signs, words, speech, physical sensations, environment, etc.\r\n\tFive classes of Suggestion\r\n\t\tLocus of Control \r\n\t\t\tInternal Locus of Control \n(Observing interpretation of opinion/suggestions)\r\n\t\t\tExternal Locus of Control \n(Unconsciously assigning meaning to opinion/suggestions)\r\n\t\tI.

The Suggestion of Association\r\n\t\t\tIt very easy for us to associate certain things with certain other things, and we will find that when one of the things is recalled it will bring with it its associated impressions.\r\n\t\tIII. The Suggestion of Habit\r\n\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Habit: This form of Suggestion is closely allied to the preceding phase, i. e. Suggestion of Association, in fact, some consider it to be merely a branch of the latter. \n\nBut we feel that there is a decided difference in the operation of the two phases, and accordingly prefer to treat this one as forming a separate and distinct phase. \n\nOf course, all habit is an association with something in the past, but Suggestion of Habit may arise from an original cause of Suggestion of Authority; Suggestion of Association; Suggestion of Repetition; Suggestion of Imitation; or else from an original decision of the intellect resulting from correct reasoning. \n\nThe former act or thought acts as a suggestive “outside influence,” although it belongs to one’s own mentality.\r\n\t\tIV. The Suggestion of Repetition\r\n\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Repetition: This form of Suggestion may seem to be very much akin to the preceding phase, i. e. Suggestion of Habit. \n\nBut there is a marked distinction and difference. Suggestion of Habit has its power imparted to it by the habitual repetition of the act or thought on the part of the individual; while Suggestion of Repetition gains its power by the repetition of a Suggestion from some outside object or person. \n\nIt is the constant dripping of water wearing away the stone. \n\nA Suggestion which passes you without much attention or consideration, when first made, will gain both attention and consideration from you if it be repeated sufficiently often, and in the right manner. \r\n\t\tV. The Suggestion of Imitation\r\n\t\t\tThe Suggestion of Imitation: This form of Suggestion while being in itself a distinct phase of Suggestion, nevertheless has a very close relationship with the several other forms of Suggestion. \n\nIn the acceptance of Suggestion of Authority there is to be found an unconscious imitation of the mental attitude of the person asserting the authority; in Suggestion of Association there is an imitation of the associated thing; and in Suggestion of Repetition there is to be found evidences of imitation. Examples Are found in schools of philosophies, theories, thought and religion.\r\n\t\tThe Blending\r\n\t\t\tThe phenomena of Suggestion and that of Auto-Suggestion can also blend into each other in subtle degrees. \n\nFor instance, one may receive an impression from outside—an impression which is the effect of a suggestion from outside—and being impressed by it, they may think it over and think and feel about it, so that the idea takes a firm hold upon them. \n\nUp to this point it is Suggestion in its general phase. \n\nBut, then the suggestion is repeated to themselves, both in self-communion and in conversation with others, until an impression is made much deeper than that caused by the original impression. This secondary effect is Auto-Suggestion, of course.\r\n\t\t\tThere is another form of Auto-Suggestion which is overlooked by many of the authorities. \n\nWe refer to cases of involuntary AutoSuggestion—cases in which the person impresses suggestions upon himself without intending to do so.\r\n\tAuto-Suggestion\r\n\t\tBy “Auto-Suggestion” is meant the application of the principles of Suggestion by one self upon oneself. \n\nIn Auto Suggestion the individual plays the dual role of suggester and suggestee, respectively. \n\nIn all other respects it is precisely the same thing as Suggestion in its general phases. \nIn Auto-Suggestion may be noticed the five phases of Suggestion, viz: Suggestion of Authority, Suggestion of Association, Suggestion of Habit, Suggestion of Repetition and Suggestion of Imitation, respectively.\r\n\t\t\tOne may suggest habits of thought, Suggestion and Auto-Suggestion action and feeling upon himself, just as truly as habits may be induced by suggestions from without. \n\nAs for the Suggestion of Repetition, it will be found that this phase of Suggestion plays a most important part in Auto-Suggestion. \n\nEven Suggestion of Imitation plays its part in Auto-Suggestion, for one may suggest to himself that he will imitate others; emulate them; pattern after them; model upon them; if he so desires. \n\nIn short, in Auto-Suggestion we find that we have Suggestion in all of its many phases and forms, the only difference being that the individual gives the suggestions to himself, instead of receiving them from outside sources. \n\nThe study of Auto-Suggestion is really the study of Suggestion.\r\n\t\t\tAutoSuggestion, as the term is generally applied, we voluntarily select and choose the suggestions which we wish to impress us, and we add to their effect by repetition and attention. \n\nBut in both Suggestion and Auto-Suggestion the principle employed is precisely the same.",

You cannot have one kind of mind and another kind of environment. \n\nThis means that you cannot change your environment while leaving your mind unchanged, nor — and this is the supreme key to life and the reason for this article — can you change your mind without your environment changing too.\r\n\t\tThis then is the real key to life: if you change your mind your conditions must change too. \n\nYour body must change, your daily work or other activities must change; your home must change; the color- tone of your whole life must change, for whether you be habitually happy and cheerful, or low-spirited and fearful, depends entirely on the quality of the mental food upon which you diet yourself. \n\nPlease be very clear about this. If you change your mind your conditions must change too.\r\n\t\tMoods\r\n\t\t\tYes, you can choose your moods. Indeed, if you could not you would have no real control over your life at all.\r\n\t\t\tMoods habitually entertained produce the characteristic disposition of the person concerned, and it is his disposition that finally makes or mars a person's happiness.\r\n\t\t\tThis will be exceedingly difficult for the first few days, but if you persevere you will find that it will become rapidly easier, and it is actually the most interesting experiment that you could possibly make. \n\nIn fact, this thought control is the most thrillingly interesting hobby that anyone could take up. You will be amazed at the interesting things that you will learn about yourself, and you will get results almost from the beginning.\r\n\tThree important considerations \r\n\t\t1. Make up your mind to devote one week solely to the task of building a new habit of thought, and during that week let everything in life be unimportant as compared with that.\r\n\t\t 2. For seven days you must not allow yourself to dwell for a single moment on any kind of negative thought.\n\nFirst of all, what do I mean by negative thinking? Well, a negative thought is any thought of failure, disappointment, or trouble; any thought of criticism, or spite, or jealousy, or condemnation of others, or self-condemnation; any thought of sickness or accident; or, in short, any kind of limitation or pessimistic thinking.\r\n\t\t3. Second, you must be quite clear that what this calls for is that you shall not entertain, or dwell upon negative things.\n\nNote this carefully. It is not the thoughts that come to you that matter, but only such of them as you choose to entertain and dwell upon.\r\n\t\t\tIt does not matter what thoughts may come to you provided you do not entertain them. It is the entertaining or dwelling upon them that matters.\r\n\t\t\tSome of them will just drift into your mind of their own accord seemingly, and these come to you out of the race mind. \n\nOther negative thoughts will be given to you by other people, either in conversation or by their conduct, or you will hear disagreeable news perhaps by letter or telephone, or you will see crimes and disasters announced in the newspaper headings.\r\n\t\t\tThese things, however, do not matter as long as you do not entertain them.\r\n\t\t\t4. When the negative thought floats into your mind, immediately turn it out and think of something else. Best of all, think of God as explained in The Golden Key.\r\n\t\t\t\tNow what of those negative thoughts and conditions which it is impossible to avoid at the point where you are today? \n\nWhat of the ordinary troubles that you will have to meet in the office or at home?\r\n\t\t\t\tThe answer is, that such things (negative experiences or conditions) will not affect your diet provided that you do not accept them, by fearing them, by believing them, by being indignant or sad about them, or by giving them any power at all.\r\n\t\t\tDuring\r\n\t\t\t\t Suppose your whole world seems to rock on its foundations. \n\nHold on steadily, let it rock, and when the rocking is over, the picture will have reassembled itself into something much nearer to your heart's desire.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe above point is vitally important and rather subtle. Do you not see that the very dwelling upon these difficulties is in itself a negative thought which has probably thrown you off the diet? \n\nThe remedy is not, of course, to deny that your world is rocking in appearance, but to refuse to take the appearance for the reality. \n\nJudge not according to appearances but judge righteous judgment.",

According to the degree of your conscious intelligence you will grasp the power that is yours. \n\nAccording to your conscious intelligence, you will project images into the Subconscious Mind which are great or small. Thus there will be returned to you only those circumstances of which you are capable of conceiving. \n\nBut whatever you conceive will be returned to you; and if doubt and fear predominate your thinking, those very things that you fear will be visited upon you, for they are convictions that the Subconscious Mind must create into actuality.\r\n\tThe Pathway of Intuition\r\n\t\tIntuition is that aspect of mental power which enables a person to \"contact\" certain aspects of the Subconscious Mind with ease.\r\n\t\tIntuition is a proof that the Universal Subconscious Mind contains the knowledge of the law and will reveal it to the Conscious Mind of man when a proper rapport is established.\r\n\t\t\tHarmony flows through you...

We find ourselves endowed with tact, instinct, sense of the beautiful in art, music, etc., or whose origin or dwelling place we are wholly unconscious.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe value of the subconscious is enormous; it inspires us; it warns us; it furnishes us with names, facts and scenes from the storehouse of memory.

(Charles Haanel)\r\n\t\t\t\tIt is through the subconscious that Shakespeare must have perceived, without effort, great truths which are hidden from the conscious mind of the student; that Phidias fashioned marble and bronze; that Raphael painted Madonnas and Beethoven composed symphonies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe subconscious soul, like a benevolent stranger, works and makes provision for our benefit, pouring only the mature fruit into our lap; thus ultimate analysis of thought processes shows that the subconscious is the theatre of the most important mental phenomena.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe are all aware how dependent we are upon the subconscious, and the greater, the nobler, the more brilliant our thoughts are, the more it is obvious to ourselves that the origin lays beyond our ken. We find ourselves endowed with tact, instinct, sense of the beautiful in art, music, etc., or whose origin or dwelling place we are wholly unconscious.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe value of the subconscious is enormous; it inspires us; it warns us; it furnishes us with names, facts and scenes from the storehouse of memory. It directs our thoughts, tastes, and accomplishes tasks so intricate that no conscious mind, even if it had the power, has the capacity for."

If it is an automobile business we have in mind, we visit automobile factories and observe the method of building an automobile.\n\nSo with the home. We visit the homes of our friends, we become acquainted with the various kinds of architecture, the kinds of brick and timber, the arrangement of rooms and every other detail which will help to '' throw light '' upon the thought of the home which we are contemplating now. \n\n- George Schubel, How To Make Our Mental Pictures Come True."

That which we will not affirm as true of ourselves cannot develop in our life.\n\t\t\tDr. Millikan wrote his dream of greatness and security in the first person, present tense. \n\nHe made his future dream a present fact. “I have,” said he, “a lavish, steady, dependable income, consistent with integrity and mutual benefit.”"

You must learn to trust your creative mechanism to do its work and not \"jam it\" by becoming too concerned or too anxious as to whether it will work or not, or by attempting to force it by too much conscious effort. You must \"let it\" work, rather than \"make it\" work.",

Your built-in success mechanism must have a goal or \"target.\" This goal, or target, must be conceived of as \"already in existence—now\" either in actual or potential form.\r\n\t\t\t2. The automatic mechanism is teleological, that is, operates, or must be oriented to \"end results,\" goals. \n\nDo not be discouraged because the \"means whereby\" may not be apparent.\n\nIt is the function of the automatic mechanism to supply the \"means whereby\" when you supply the goal. Think in terms of the end result, and the means whereby will often take care of themselves.\r\n\t\t\t3. Do not be afraid of making mistakes, or of temporary failures. \n\nAll servo-mechanisms achieve a goal by negative feedback, or by going forward, making mistakes, and immediately correcting course.\r\n\t\t\t4. Skill learning of any kind is accomplished by trial and error, mentally correcting aim after an error, until a \"successful\" motion, movement or performance has been achieved. \n\nAfter that, further learning, and continued success, is accomplished by forgetting the past DISCOVERING YOUR SUCCESS MECHANISM 'errors, and remembering the successful response, so that it can be \"imitated.\"\r\n\t\t\t5. You must learn to trust your creative mechanism to do its work and not \"jam it\" by becoming too concerned or too anxious as to whether it will work or not, or by attempting to force it by too much conscious effort. You must \"let it\" work, rather than \"make it\" work."

My faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time, and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money, and I will follow that plan, when it is received.\n\t\tZig Ziglar's wheel of life"

Practice equanimity: Foster calm emotional responses.\r\n\t\t\t4. Try to see positive aspects in everything and to make the best out of every situation.\r\n\t\t\t5. Practice being open to new experiences and ideas, never letting expectations based upon the past close your mind to the lessons of the moment.\r\n\t\t\t6. Find a harmonious, balanced relationship between the above five qualities, practicing each regularly and becoming able to move dynamically between them.\r\n\t\t\tNow this is how we do it. At the end of my day, I review the day; I don't judge it, I simply review it. \n\nI look over the entire day, all the episodes, all the events, all the conversations, all the meetings, and then as I see it clearly in my mind's eye, I rewrite it.\n\nI rewrite it and make it conform to the ideal day I wish I had experienced. \n\nI take scene after scene and rewrite it, revise it, and having revised my day, then in my imagination I relive that day, the revised day, and I do it over and over in my imagination until this seeming imagined state begins to take on to me the tones of reality.\n\nIt seems that it's real, that I actually did experience it and I have found from experience that these revised days, if really lived, will change my tomorrows. \n\nWhen I meet people tomorrow that today disappointed me, they will not tomorrow, for in me I have changed the very nature of that being, and having changed him, he bears witness tomorrow of the change that took place within me.\n\nIt is my duty to take this garden= and really make it a garden by daily using the pruning shears of revision."

It is only by a change of consciousness, by actually changing your concept of yourself, that you can \"build more stately mansions\" — the manifestations of higher and higher concepts. \r\n\t\tSomewhere in your make-up (perhaps in the cells of your brain) there lies sleeping, the seed of achievement which, if aroused and put into action, would carry you to heights, such as you may never have hoped to attain.\r\n\t\tPsychologists have correctly said that \"when one is truly ready for a thing, it puts in its appearance.\"\nBarnes was ready for a business association with Edison, moreover, he was DETERMINED TO REMAIN READY UNTIL HE GOT THAT WHICH HE WAS SEEKING.\r\n\t2. You must turn from the objective appearance of things to the subjective center of things, your consciousness, if you truly desire to know the cause of the phenomena of life, and how to use this knowledge to realize your fondest dreams.\r\n\t\tRemember, too, that all who succeed in life get off to a bad start, and pass through many heartbreaking struggles before they \"arrive.\" The turning point in the lives of those who succeed, usually comes at the moment of some crisis, through which they are introduced to their \"other selves.\"\r\n\t\tAll sense impressions which are perceived through the five senses, are stopped by the CONSCIOUS thinking mind, and may be either passed on to the subconscious mind, or rejected, at will. The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as an outer-guard to the approach of the subconscious.\r\n\t\tTHE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND consists of a field of consciousness, in which every impulse of thought that reaches the objective mind through any of the five senses, is classified and recorded, and from which thoughts may be recalled or withdrawn as letters may be taken from a filing cabinet.\n\nIt receives, and files, sense impressions or thoughts, regardless of their nature. You may VOLUNTARILY plant in your subconscious mind any plan, thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary equivalent.\r\n\t3. Man's chief delusion is his conviction that there are causes other than his own state of consciousness. All that befalls a man — all that is done by him — all that comes from him — happens as a result of his state of consciousness.\r\n\t\tThe subconscious mind will transmute into its physical equivalent, by the most direct and practical media available, any order which is given to it in a state of BELIEF, or FAITH that the order will be carried out.\r\n\t\tThe imagination is literally the workshop wherein are fashioned all plans created by man. The impulse, the DESIRE, is given shape, form, and ACTION through the aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind.\r\n\t\tCREATIVE IMAGINATION:— Through the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. It is the faculty through which \"hunches\" and \"inspirations\" are received. It is by this faculty that all basic, or new ideas are handed over to man\r\n\t4. The changes which take place in your life as a result of your changed concept of yourself always appear to the unenlightened to be the result, not of a change of your consciousness, but of chance, outer cause, or coincidence.\r\n\t\tThe subconscious mind will not remain idle! If you fail to plant DESIRES in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the result of your neglect. \r\n\t\tThere are four simple steps which lead to the habit of PERSISTENCE. They call for no great amount of intelligence, no particular amount of education, and but little time or effort. The necessary steps are:—\n\r\n\t\t\t1. A DEFINITE PURPOSE BACKED BY BURNING DESIRE FOR ITS FULFILLMENT.\r\n\t\t\t2. A DEFINITE PLAN, EXPRESSED IN CONTINUOUS ACTION.\r\n\t\t\t3. A MIND CLOSED TIGHTLY AGAINST ALL NEGATIVE AND DISCOURAGING INFLUENCES, including negative suggestions of relatives, friends and acquaintances.\r\n\t\t\t4. A FRIENDLY ALLIANCE WITH ONE OR MORE PERSONS WHO WILL ENCOURAGE ONE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH BOTH PLAN AND PURPOSE.\r\n\t5. All transformation is based upon suggestion, and this can work only where you lay yourself completely open to an influence.\r\n\t\tAUTO-SUGGESTION is a term which applies to all suggestions and all self-administered stimuli which reach one's mind through the five senses. Stated in another way, auto-suggestion is self-suggestion. It is the agency of communication between that part of the mind where conscious thought takes place, and that which serves as the seat of action for the subconscious mind.\r\n\t\tNot only thought impulses which have been mixed with FAITH, but those which have been mixed with any of the positive emotions, or any of the negative emotions, may reach, and influence the subconscious mind.\r\n\t6. Therefore, when you know what you want, you must deliberately focus your attention on the feeling of your wish fulfilled until that feeling fills the mind and crowds all other ideas out of consciousness.\r\n\t\tA mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for the state of mind known as faith. A mind so dominated may, at will, give the subconscious mind instructions, which it will accept and act upon immediately.\r\n\t\tFortunes gravitate to those whose minds have been prepared to \"attract\" them, just as surely as water gravitates to the ocean. In this book may be found all the stimuli necessary to \"attune\" any normal mind to the vibrations which will attract the object of one's desires.\r\n\t7. Persistence in this assumption will result in actually experiencing in fact that which you assumed.\r\n\t\tThrough some strange and powerful principle of \"mental chemistry\" which she has never divulged, Nature wraps up in the impulse of STRONG DESIRE \"that something\" which recognizes no such word as impossible, and accepts no such reality as failure.\r\n\t\tEvery person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a BURNING DESIRE TO WIN, essential to success.\r\n\t\tThere is a difference between WISHING for a thing and being READY to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be BELIEF, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief.\r\n\t8. All progress, all fulfillment of desire, depend upon the control and concentration of your attention. Attention may be either attracted from without or directed from within.\r\n\t\tA great many years ago I purchased a fine dictionary. The first thing I did with it was to turn to the word \"impossible,\" and neatly clip it out of the book. That would not be an unwise thing for you to do.\nSuccess comes to those who become SUCCESS CONSCIOUS.

In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute.\r\n\t\t\tA man may rise to high success in the world, and even to lofty altitudes in the spiritual realm, and again descend into weakness and wretchedness by allowing arrogant, selfish, and corrupt thoughts to take possession of him.\r\n\t\tSerenity\r\n\t\t\tCALMNESS of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought.\r\n\t\t\tThe calm man, having learned how to govern himself, knows how to adapt himself to others; and they, in turn, reverence his spiritual strength, and feel that they can learn of him and rely upon him. The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good. Even the ordinary trader will find his business prosperity increase as he develops a greater self-control and equanimity, for people will always prefer to deal with a man whose demeanour is strongly equable.\r\n\t\t\tTempest-tossed souls, wherever ye may be, under whatsoever conditions ye may live, know this: In the ocean of life the isles of Blessedness are smiling, and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming. Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of thought. In the bark of your soul reclines the commanding Master; He does but sleep: wake Him. Self-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is power. Say unto your heart, \"Peace, be still!\"",

Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.\r\n\t\t\tHaving aim gives us purpose and brings us into flow\r\n\t\t\tWith unwavering focus, weed-seeds are excluded out of consciousness\r\n\t\t\tWith aim, conscious action in service to others is brought forth, also as example\r\n\t\tThose who are not prepared for the apprehension of a great purpose should fix the thoughts upon the faultless performance of their duty, no matter how insignificant their task may appear. \n\nOnly in this way can the thoughts be gathered and focussed, and resolution and energy be developed, which being done, there is nothing which may not be accomplished.\r\n\t\tThe Thought-Factor in Achievement\r\n\t\t\tALL that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts. In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute.\r\n\t\t\tA man may rise to high success in the world, and even to lofty altitudes in the spiritual realm, and again descend into weakness and wretchedness by allowing arrogant, selfish, and corrupt thoughts to take possession of him.\r\n\t\tSerenity\r\n\t\t\tCALMNESS of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought.\r\n\t\t\tThe calm man, having learned how to govern himself, knows how to adapt himself to others; and they, in turn, reverence his spiritual strength, and feel that they can learn of him and rely upon him. The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good. Even the ordinary trader will find his business prosperity increase as he develops a greater self-control and equanimity, for people will always prefer to deal with a man whose demeanour is strongly equable.\r\n\t\t\tTempest-tossed souls, wherever ye may be, under whatsoever conditions ye may live, know this: In the ocean of life the isles of Blessedness are smiling, and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming. Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of thought. In the bark of your soul reclines the commanding Master; He does but sleep: wake Him. Self-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is power. Say unto your heart, \"Peace, be still!\""

      "text": "Breaking The Habit of Being Yourself: How to Lose Your Mind and Create a New One\nDr. Joe Dispenza\r\n\tOvercoming Your Environment\r\n\t\tWhat quantum physicists discovered was that the person observing (or measuring) the tiny particles that make up atoms affects the behavior of energy and matter. Quantum experiments demonstrated that electrons exist simultaneously in an infinite array of possibilities or probabilities in an invisible field of energy. But only when an observer focuses attention on any location of any one electron does that electron appear. In other words, a particle cannot manifest in reality—that is, ordinary space-time as we know it—until we observe it.\r\n\t\tDuring our waking hours, as we routinely interact with the diverse stimuli in our world, our external environment activates various brain circuits. As a consequence of that nearly automatic response, we begin to think (and react) equal to our environment.\r\n\t\tEvery time you respond to your familiar reality by re-creating the same mind (that is, turning on the same nerve cells to make the brain work in the same way), you “hard- wire” your brain to match the customary conditions in your personal reality, be they good or bad.\r\n\t\thabits of transformation\r\n\t\t\tTo create a new personal reality, a new life, we must create a new personality; we must become someone else. To change, then, is to “be” greater than our present circum- stances, greater than our environment.\r\n\t\t\tGreatness Is Holding Fast to a Dream, Independent of the Environment\r\n\t\t\t\tThe greatest individuals in history were unwaveringly committed to a future destiny without any need for immediate feed- back from the environment. It didn’t matter to them if they hadn’t yet received any sensory indication or physical evidence of the change they wanted; they must have “reminded” themselves daily of the reality they were focused upon. Their minds were ahead of their present environment, because their environment no longer controlled their thinking. Truly, they were ahead of their time.\r\n\t\t\t\tAnother fundamental element shared by each of these celebrated beings was that they were clear in their minds about exactly what they wanted to happen.\r\n\t\t\tMental Rehearsal\r\n\t\t\t\tNeuroscience has proven that we can change our brains—and therefore our behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs—just by thinking differently (in other words, without changing anything in our environment). Through mental rehearsal (repeatedly imagining performing an action), the circuits in the brain can reorganize themselves to reflect our objectives. We can make our thoughts so real that the brain changes to look like the event has already become a physical reality. We can change it to be ahead of any actual experience in our external world.\r\n\t\t\t\tIf we repeatedly think about something to the exclusion of everything else, we encounter a moment when the thought becomes the experience. When this occurs, the neural hard- ware is rewired to re ect the thought as the experience. This is the moment that our thinking changes our brains and thus, our minds.\r\n\t\t\tReplace old habits (prune old neural connections) with new ones (sprout new neural networks).\r\n\t\t\t\tWhether we physically or mentally acquire a skill, there are four elements that we all use to change our brains: learning knowledge, receiving hands-on instruction, paying attention, and repetition.\r\n\t\t\t\tLearning is making synaptic connections; instruction gets the body involved in order to have a new experience, which further enriches the brain. When we also pay attention and repeat our new skill over and over again, our brains will change.\r\n\tThree Brains: Thinking to Doing to Being\r\n\t\tThe gift of neuroplasticity (the brain’s ability to rewire and create new circuits at any age as a result of input from the environment and our conscious intentions) is that we can create a new level of mind. There’s a sort of neurological “out with the old, in with the new,” a process that neuroscientists call pruning and sprouting. It’s what I call unlearning and learning, and it creates the opportunity for us to rise above our current limitations and to be greater than our conditioning or circumstances.\r\n\t\tThe “first brain,” the neocortex or thinking brain.\n\nThe “second brain” is the limbic or emotional brain, responsible for creating, maintaining, and organizing chemicals in the body.\n\nThe “third brain,” the cerebellum, is the seat of the subconscious mind.\r\n\t\t\tThe Neocortex Processes Knowledge, Then Prompts Us to Live What We Learned\r\n\t\t\t\tFirst, you gather knowledge in the form of facts or semantic information (philosophical or theoretical concepts or ideas that you learn intellectually), prompting the neocortex to add new synaptic connections and circuits.\r\n\t\t\t\tSecond, once you decide to personalize or apply knowledge you have acquired—to demonstrate what you learned—you will invariably create a new experience. This causes patterns of neurons called neural networks to form in the neocortex. These net- works reinforce the circuitry of what you learned intellectually.\r\n\t\t\tThe Limbic Brain Produces Chemicals to Help Us Remember Experiences\r\n\t\t\t\tthe limbic brain assists in forming long-term memories: you can remember any experience better because you can recall how you felt emotionally while the event was occur- ring. (The neocortex and limbic brain together enable us to form declarative memories, meaning that we can declare what we’ve learned or experienced.\r\n\t\t\t\tIf knowledge is for the mind, and experience is for the body, then when you apply knowledge and create a new experience, you teach the body what the mind has intellectually learned. Knowledge without experience is merely philosophy; experience without knowledge is ignorance. There’s a progression that has to take place. You have to take knowledge and live it—embrace it emotionally.\r\n\t\t\t\tIf you’re still with me as I’ve been discussing how to change your life, you’ve learned about gaining knowledge, and then taking action to have a new experience, which produces a new feeling.\r\n\t\t\tThe Cerebellum Stores Habitual Thoughts, Attitudes, and Behaviors\r\n\t\t\t\twhen the body knows equal to or better than the conscious mind, when you can repeat an experience at will without much conscious effort, then you have memorized the action, behavior, attitude, or emotional reaction until it has become a skill or a habit.\r\n\t\t\t\tWhen you reach this level of ability, you have moved into a state of being. In the process, you’ve activated the third brain area that plays a major role in changing your life—the cerebellum, seat of the subconscious.\r\n\t\t\tKnowledge + Experience = Wisdom\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\tGiven that to change our lives, we first have to change our thoughts and feelings, then do something (change our actions or behaviors) to have a new experience, which in turn produces a new feeling, and then we must memorize that feeling until we move into a state of being (when mind and body are one), at least we’ve got a few things going for us. Along with the brain being neuroplastic, we could say that we have more than one brain to work with. In effect, we have three of them.\r\n\tBrain-Wave States\r\n\t\tBrain-Wave States\r\n\t\t\tBeta. As you’re reading this chapter, most likely you are in the everyday waking state of Beta brain-wave activity. Your brain is processing sensory data and trying to create meaning between your outer and inner worlds. While you are engaged in this book’s material, you may feel the weight of your body on your seat, you may hear music in the background, you may glance up and see out a window. All of this data is being processed by your thinking neocortex.\r\n\t\t\tAlpha. Now, let’s say that you close your eyes (80 percent of our sensory information derives from sight) and purposefully go inward. Since you are greatly reducing sensory data from the environment, less information is entering your nervous system. Your brain waves naturally slow down into the Alpha state. You relax. You become less preoccupied with the elements in your outer world, and the internal world begins to consume your attention. You tend to think and analyze less. In Alpha, the brain is in a light meditative state\r\n\t\t\tTheta. In adults, Theta waves emerge in the twilight state or lucid state, during which some people  nd themselves half-awake and half-asleep (the conscious mind is awake, while the body is some- what asleep). This is the state when a hypnotherapist can access the subconscious mind. In Theta, we are more programmable because there is no veil between the conscious and subconscious minds.\r\n\t\t\tDelta. For most of us, Delta waves are representative of deep sleep. In this realm there is very little conscious awareness, and the body is restoring itself.\r\n\t\tThree Levels of Beta Waves Govern Our Waking Hours\r\n\t\t\tSince we spend most of our conscious waking day with our attention on the external environment and functioning in Beta, let’s talk about the three levels of these brain-wave patterns.2 This understanding will facilitate moving from Beta to Alpha and ultimately to Theta in the meditative state.\r\n\t\t\t1. Low-range Beta is defined as relaxed, interested attention ranging from 13 to 15 hertz (cycles per second). If you are enjoying reading a book and are familiar with the material, your brain would probably be  ring in low Beta, because you are paying a certain degree of attention without any vigilance.\r\n\t\t\t2. Mid-range Beta is produced during focused attention on sustained external stimuli. Learning is a good example: if I were to test you on what you read while enjoying that book in low Beta, you would have to perk up a bit, and thus there would be more neocortical activity such as analytical thinking. Mid-Beta operates between 16 and 22 hertz. With mid-range Beta and even low-range Beta to some extent, these frequencies reflect our conscious or rational thinking and our alertness. They are a result of the neocortex taking in stimuli from the environment through all of our senses and assembling the information into a package to create a level of mind.\r\n\t\t\t3. High-range Beta is characterized by any brain-wave pattern from 22 to 50 hertz. High-Beta patterns are observed during stressful situations where those nasty survival chemicals are produced in the body. Maintaining this sustained focus in such a high-arousal state is not the type of focused attention we use to learn, create, dream, problem solve, or even heal. In truth, we could say that the brain in high Beta is functioning with too much focused concentration. The mind is too amped up and the body is too stimulated to be in any semblance of order. (When you’re in high Beta, just know for now that you are probably focusing on something too much and it’s hard to stop.)\r\n\t\t\t\tSustained High Beta Makes It Hard to Focus on Our Inner Self\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn high Beta, the outer world appears to be more real than the inner world. Our attention and conscious awareness primarily focus on everything that makes up the external environment. Thus, we identify more readily with those material elements: we criticize everyone we know, we judge the way our bodies look, we’re overfocused on our problems, we cling to things we own out of fear that we might lose them, we busy ourselves with places we have to go, and we’re preoccupied with time. That leaves us little processing power to pay attention to the changes that we truly want to make—to go inward to observe and monitor our thoughts, behavior, and emotions.\r\n\t\tProgramming the subconscious mind\r\n\t\t\tAwareness, Not Analysis,\nPermits Entry into the Subconscious\r\n\t\t\tAwareness can exist outside of analysis. When you are aware, you may think, I’m feeling angry. When you are analyzing, you go beyond that simple observation to add: Why is this page taking so long to load?\r\n\t\t\tMeditation Takes Us Beyond Analytical Mind and into the Subconscious\r\n\t\t\t\tFor the most part, when adults are conscious, their analytical minds are always working, and thus they are functioning in some realm of Beta waves.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tThe subconscious mind, which makes up about 95 percent of who we are, consists of those positive and negative identifications and associations that give rise to habits and behaviors.\r\n\t\t\t\tMeditation Takes Us from Beta into Alpha and Theta Brain-Wave States\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOne of the main purposes of meditation is to go beyond the conscious mind and enter the subconscious mind, in order to change self-destructive habits, behaviors, beliefs, emotional reactions, attitudes, and unconscious states of being.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is quite possible to consciously alter your brain waves from that high-frequency Beta state into Alpha and Theta (you can train yourself to move up and down the scale of brain waves). As you do, you will open doors to true personal change. You trespass beyond the common type of thinking that is fueled by reactions to being in survival mode; you are entering the realm of the subconscious mind.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring meditation, you transcend the feelings of the body, are no longer at the mercy of the environment, and lose track of time. You forget about you as an identity. As you close your eyes, the input from the outside world is reduced, and your neocortex has less to think about and analyze. As a result, the analytical mind begins to become subdued, and electrical activity in the neocortex quiets down.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThen when you restfully pay attention, concentrate, and focus in a relaxed manner, you automatically activate the frontal lobe, which reduces synaptic  firing in the rest of the neocortex. Therefore, you lower the volume to the circuits in the brain that process time and space. This allows your brain waves to naturally slow down to Alpha. Now you are moving from a state of survival into a more creative state, and your brain naturally recalibrates itself to a more orderly, coherent brain-wave pattern.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOne of the later steps of meditation, if you keep practicing, is to move into the Theta-wave frequency, when your body is asleep but your mind is awake. This is a magical land. You are now in a deeper system of the subconscious and able to immediately change those negative associations to more positive ones.\r\n\t\tMeditation\r\n\t\t\tIn the Tibetan language, to meditate means “to become familiar with.” Accordingly, I use the term meditation as a synonym for self-observation as well as self-development. After all, to become familiar with anything, we have to spend some time observing it.\n\nAnother way to think of this transition is when you go from being a doer to a doer/watcher. An easy analogy I can use is that when athletes or performers—golfers, skiers, swimmers, dancers, singers, or actors—want to change something about their technique, most coaches have them watch videotape of themselves.\r\n\t\t\tBesides its meaning in Tibetan, to meditate in Sanskrit means “to cultivate self.” I especially like this definition because of the metaphorical possibilities it offers—for example, gardening or agriculture. When you cultivate the soil, you take the packed-down earth that has been lying fallow for a while and you churn it up with a spade or other implement. \n\nYou expose “new” dirt and nutrients, making it easier for seeds to germinate and for tender shoots to take root. Cultivation may also require you to remove plants from the previous season, attend to weeds that went unnoticed, and remove any rocks that rose to the surface by natural sifting.\r\n\t\t\tWhen we use meditation as a means to change, when we become conscious and aware, familiar with and willing to do what is necessary to eradicate an undesirable trait and cultivate a desired one, we’re doing what mystics have been doing for centuries.",

      "originalText": "Breaking The Habit of Being Yourself: How to Lose Your Mind and Create a New One\nDr. Joe Dispenza\r\n\tOvercoming Your Environment\r\n\t\tWhat quantum physicists discovered was that the person observing (or measuring) the tiny particles that make up atoms affects the behavior of energy and matter. Quantum experiments demonstrated that electrons exist simultaneously in an infinite array of possibilities or probabilities in an invisible field of energy. But only when an observer focuses attention on any location of any one electron does that electron appear. In other words, a particle cannot manifest in reality—that is, ordinary space-time as we know it—until we observe it.\r\n\t\tDuring our waking hours, as we routinely interact with the diverse stimuli in our world, our external environment activates various brain circuits. As a consequence of that nearly automatic response, we begin to think (and react) equal to our environment.\r\n\t\tEvery time you respond to your familiar reality by re-creating the same mind (that is, turning on the same nerve cells to make the brain work in the same way), you “hard- wire” your brain to match the customary conditions in your personal reality, be they good or bad.\r\n\t\thabits of transformation\r\n\t\t\tTo create a new personal reality, a new life, we must create a new personality; we must become someone else. To change, then, is to “be” greater than our present circum- stances, greater than our environment.\r\n\t\t\tGreatness Is Holding Fast to a Dream, Independent of the Environment\r\n\t\t\t\tThe greatest individuals in history were unwaveringly committed to a future destiny without any need for immediate feed- back from the environment. It didn’t matter to them if they hadn’t yet received any sensory indication or physical evidence of the change they wanted; they must have “reminded” themselves daily of the reality they were focused upon. Their minds were ahead of their present environment, because their environment no longer controlled their thinking. Truly, they were ahead of their time.\r\n\t\t\t\tAnother fundamental element shared by each of these celebrated beings was that they were clear in their minds about exactly what they wanted to happen.\r\n\t\t\tMental Rehearsal\r\n\t\t\t\tNeuroscience has proven that we can change our brains—and therefore our behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs—just by thinking differently (in other words, without changing anything in our environment). Through mental rehearsal (repeatedly imagining performing an action), the circuits in the brain can reorganize themselves to reflect our objectives. We can make our thoughts so real that the brain changes to look like the event has already become a physical reality. We can change it to be ahead of any actual experience in our external world.\r\n\t\t\t\tIf we repeatedly think about something to the exclusion of everything else, we encounter a moment when the thought becomes the experience.

      "text": "Allowing vs Force\r\n\tPremise\r\n\t\tPast and future are dreams; now is a reality. All things are now; all power, all possibility, all action is now. \n\nNot to act and accomplish now is not to act and accomplish at all. \n\nTo live in thoughts of what you might have done, or in dreams of what you mean to do, this is folly: but to put away regret, to anchor anticipation, and to do and to work now, this is wisdom.\r\n\t7 Stages of Spiritual Alchemy\r\n\t\t1. Calcination (Here is where we start letting go of egotism, self-doubt...)\r\n\t\t\tLet a man put away egotism, and he will see the universe in all the beauty of its pristine simplicity. \n\nLet him annihilate the delusion of the personal \"I,\" and he will destroy all the illusions which spring from that \"I.\" \n\nHe will thus \"re-become a little child,\" and will \"revert to Original Simplicity.\"\r\n\t\t2. Dissolution (In this phase lack of responsibility, avoidance of traumatizing memories, and other inner resistance elements are brought forth for purification.)\r\n\t\t\tThou hast thy trials? Every outward trial is the replica of an inward imperfection. \n\nThou shalt grow wise by knowing this, and shalt thereby transmute trial into active joy, finding the Kingdom where trial cannot come.\r\n\t\t3. Separation (What is authentic and true to you. How do you really want to be, this or that...)\r\n\t\t\tMan evolves outward to the periphery of complexity, and then involves backward to the Central Simplicity. \n\nHe then starts upon the Way which leads to the Original Simplicity.\r\n\t\t4. Conjunction (Accept and integrate the parts of your authentic self.)\r\n\t\t\tSay to yourself, \"I will live in my Ideal now; I will manifest my Ideal now; I will be my Ideal now; and all that tempts me away\r\n\t\t\tfrom my Ideal I will not listen to; I will listen only to the voice of my Ideal.\" Thus resolving, and thus doing, you shall not de-part from the Highest, and shall eternally manifest the True.\r\n\t\t5. Fermentation (We deepen our connection to the inner voice while detaching from certain past identifications.)\r\n\t\t\tSaid a great Teacher to his disciples, \"Those who shall be a lamp unto them-selves, relying upon themselves only, and not relying upon any external help, but holding fast to the Truth as their lamp, and, seeking their salvation in the Truth alone, shall not look for assistance to any besides themselves, it is they among my disciples who shall reach the very topmost height! But they must be willing to learn.\"\r\n\t\t6. Distillation (Integrate inner realizations into our lives in order to allow them to become permanent.

All things are now; all power, all possibility, all action is now. \n\nNot to act and accomplish now is not to act and accomplish at all. \n\nTo live in thoughts of what you might have done, or in dreams of what you mean to do, this is folly: but to put away regret, to anchor anticipation, and to do and to work now, this is wisdom.\r\n\t7 Stages of Spiritual Alchemy\r\n\t\t1. Calcination (Here is where we start letting go of egotism, self-doubt...)\r\n\t\t\tLet a man put away egotism, and he will see the universe in all the beauty of its pristine simplicity. \n\nLet him annihilate the delusion of the personal \"I,\" and he will destroy all the illusions which spring from that \"I.\" \n\nHe will thus \"re-become a little child,\" and will \"revert to Original Simplicity.\"\r\n\t\t2. Dissolution (In this phase lack of responsibility, avoidance of traumatizing memories, and other inner resistance elements are brought forth for purification.)\r\n\t\t\tThou hast thy trials? Every outward trial is the replica of an inward imperfection. \n\nThou shalt grow wise by knowing this, and shalt thereby transmute trial into active joy, finding the Kingdom where trial cannot come.\r\n\t\t3. Separation (What is authentic and true to you. How do you really want to be, this or that...)\r\n\t\t\tMan evolves outward to the periphery of complexity, and then involves backward to the Central Simplicity. \n\nHe then starts upon the Way which leads to the Original Simplicity.\r\n\t\t4. Conjunction (Accept and integrate the parts of your authentic self.)\r\n\t\t\tSay to yourself, \"I will live in my Ideal now; I will manifest my Ideal now; I will be my Ideal now; and all that tempts me away\r\n\t\t\tfrom my Ideal I will not listen to; I will listen only to the voice of my Ideal.\" Thus resolving, and thus doing, you shall not de-part from the Highest, and shall eternally manifest the True.\r\n\t\t5. Fermentation (We deepen our connection to the inner voice while detaching from certain past identifications.)\r\n\t\t\tSaid a great Teacher to his disciples, \"Those who shall be a lamp unto them-selves, relying upon themselves only, and not relying upon any external help, but holding fast to the Truth as their lamp, and, seeking their salvation in the Truth alone, shall not look for assistance to any besides themselves, it is they among my disciples who shall reach the very topmost height! But they must be willing to learn.\"\r\n\t\t6. Distillation (Integrate inner realizations into our lives in order to allow them to become permanent. Finding love and flow in all things.)\r\n\t\t\tWisdom, which is the aim of every philosophy, is distinct from all philosophies. \n\nThe Unfailing Wisdom is found only by constant practice in pure thinking and well-doing; by harmonizing one’s mind and heart to those things which are beautiful, lovable, and true.\r\n\t\t7. Coagulation (One with the divine.. inner world and outer world are not different, but reflections of each other as ONE.)\r\n\t\t\tStanding upon the imperishable Principles of Purity, Compassion, Wisdom and Love, they are immortal, and know they are immortal; they are one with God (the Supreme Good), and know they are one with God. \n\nSeeing the realities of things, they can find no room anywhere for condemnation."

      "text": "Feeling Is The Secret\nBy Neville Goddard\r\n\tIntroduction\r\n\t\tHe that would perfect himself in any art whatsoever, let him betake himself to the reading of some sure and certain work upon his art many times over; for to read many books upon your art produces confusion rather than learning.\r\n\tLaw and Its Operation\r\n\t\tTHE world, and all within it, is man's conditioned consciousness objecti- fied. Consciousness is the cause as well as the substance of the entire world. So it is to consciousness that we must turn if we would discover the secret of creation.\r\n\t\tConsciousness is the one and only reality, not figuratively but actually. This reality may for the sake of clarity be likened unto a stream which is divided into two parts, the conscious and the subconscious. In order to intelligently operate the law of consciousness, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the conscious and the subconscious.\r\n\t\t\tThe conscious generates ideas and impresses these ideas on the subconscious; the subconscious receives ideas and gives form and expression to them.\r\n\t\t\tThe subconscious does not originate ideas, but accepts as true those which the conscious mind feels to be true and, in a way known only to it- self, objectifies the accepted ideas. Therefore, through his power to imag- ine and feel and his freedom to choose the idea he will entertain, man has control over creation. Control of the subconscious is accomplished through control of your ideas and feelings.\r\n\t\t\tBy control of feeling is not meant restraint or suppression of your feeling, but rather the disciplining of self to imagine and entertain only such feeling as contributes to your happiness.\r\n\t\t\tNo idea can be impressed on the subconscious until it is felt, but once felt - be it good, bad or indifferent – it must be expressed. Feeling is the one and only medium through which ideas are conveyed to the subconscious.\r\n\t\tTo impress the subconscious with the desirable state, you must assume the feeling that would be yours had you already realized your wish.\r\n\t\tMastery of self-control of your thoughts and feelings is your highest achievement. However, until perfect self-control is attained, so that, in spite of appearances, you feel all that you want to feel, use sleep and prayer to aid you in realizing your desired states. These are the two gate- ways into the subconscious.\r\n\tSleep\r\n\t\tSLEEP, the life that occupies one-third of our stay on earth, is the natural door into the subconscious. So it is with sleep that we are now concerned. The conscious two-thirds of our life on earth is measured by the degree of attention we give sleep.\r\n\t\tThe conditions and events of your life are your children formed from the molds of your subconscious impressions in sleep. They are made in the image and likeness of your innermost feeling that they may reveal you to yourself.\r\n\t\tOnce asleep, man has no freedom of choice. His entire slumber is domi- nated by his last waking concept of self. It follows, therefore, that he should always assume the feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction be- fore here tires in sleep\r\n\tPrayer\r\n\t\tPrayer is an illusion of sleep which diminishes the impression of the outer world and renders the mind more receptive to suggestion from within. The mind in prayer is in a state of relaxation and receptivity akin to the feeling attained just before dropping off to sleep.\r\n\t\tYour prayer must be answered if you assume the feeling that would be yours were you already in possession of your objective.

      "originalText": "Feeling Is The Secret\nBy Neville Goddard\r\n\tIntroduction\r\n\t\tHe that would perfect himself in any art whatsoever, let him betake himself to the reading of some sure and certain work upon his art many times over; for to read many books upon your art produces confusion rather than learning.\r\n\tLaw and Its Operation\r\n\t\tTHE world, and all within it, is man's conditioned consciousness objecti- fied. Consciousness is the cause as well as the substance of the entire world. So it is to consciousness that we must turn if we would discover the secret of creation.\r\n\t\tConsciousness is the one and only reality, not figuratively but actually. This reality may for the sake of clarity be likened unto a stream which is divided into two parts, the conscious and the subconscious. In order to intelligently operate the law of consciousness, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the conscious and the subconscious.\r\n\t\t\tThe conscious generates ideas and impresses these ideas on the subconscious; the subconscious receives ideas and gives form and expression to them.\r\n\t\t\tThe subconscious does not originate ideas, but accepts as true those which the conscious mind feels to be true and, in a way known only to it- self, objectifies the accepted ideas.

One commonly hears even an otherwise intelligent man declare that “No man can be successful in business unless he is dishonest,” thus regarding business prosperity – a good thing – as the effect of dishonesty – a bad thing. \r\n\tFirst pillar – Energy\r\n\t\tEnergy is a moral virtue, its opposing vice being laziness. As a virtue, it can be cultivated, and the lazy man can become energetic by forcibly arousing himself to exertion.\r\n\t\tBut energy is a composite power. It does not stand alone. Involved in it are qualities which go to the making of vigorous character and the production of prosperity. Mainly, these qualities are contained in the four following characteristics\r\n\t\t\t1. Promptitude\r\n\t\t\t\tPromptitude is valuable possession. It begets reliability. People who are alert, prompt, and punctual are relied upon. They can be trusted to do their duty, and to do it vigorously and well. \r\n\t\t\t2. Vigilance\r\n\t\t\t\tVigilance is the guard of all the faculties and powers of the mind. It is the detective that prevents the entrance of any violent and destructive element. It is the close companion and protector of all success, liberty, and wisdom. Without this watchful attitude of mind, a man is a fool, and there is no prosperity for a fool.\r\n\t\t\t3. Industry\r\n\t\t\t\tIndustry brings cheerfulness and plenty. Vigorously industrious people are the happiest members of the community. They are not always the richest, if by riches is meant a superfluity of money; but they are always the most lighthearted and joyful, and the most satisfied with what they do and have, and are therefore the richer, if by richer we mean more abundantly blessed. \r\n\t\t\t\tPeople who make themselves useful to the community, receive back from the community their full share of health, happiness, and prosperity. They brighten the daily task, and keep the world moving. They are the gold of the nation and the salt of the earth.\r\n\t\t\t4. Earnestness\r\n\t\t\t\t“Earnestness”, said a Great Teacher, “is the path of immortality. They who are in earnest do not die; they who are not in earnest are as if dead already”. Earnestness is the dedication of the entire mind to its task. We live only in what we do. Earnest people are dissatisfied with anything short of the highest excellence in whatever they do, and they always reach that excellence.\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat ever you are – whether shopkeeper or saintly teacher you can safely give the very best to the world without any doubt or misgiving. If the indelible impress of your earnestness be on your goods in the one case, or on your words in the other, your business will flourish, or your precepts will live.\r\n\tSecond pillar – Economy\r\n\t\tNature destroys every foulness, not by annihilation, but by transmutation, by sweetening and purifying it, and making it serve the ends of things beautiful, useful and good.\r\n\t\tThe Pillar of Economy, when soundly built, will be found to be composed largely of these four qualities:\r\n\t\t\t1. Moderation\r\n\t\t\t\tModeration is the strong core of economy. It avoids extremes, finding the middle way in all things. It also consists in abstaining from the unnecessary and the harmful. There can be no such things as moderation in that which is evil, for that would be excess.\r\n\t\t\t2. Efficiency\r\n\t\t\t\tEfficiency proceeds from the right conservation of one’s forces and powers. All skill is the use of concentrated energy. Superior skill, as talent and genius, is a higher degree of concentrated force. Men are always skillful in that which they love, because the mind is almost ceaselessly centered upon it. Skill is the result of that mental economy which transmutes thought into invention and action. \r\n\t\t\t3. Resourcefulness\r\n\t\t\t\tResourcefulness is the outcome of efficiency. It is an important element in prosperity, for the resourceful man is never confounded. He may have many falls, but he will always be equal to the occasion, and will be on his feet again immediately. Resourcefulness has its fundamental cause in the conservation of energy. It is energy transmuted. When a man cuts off certain mental or bodily vices which have been depleting him of his energy, what becomes of the energy so conserved? It is not destroyed or lost, for energy can never be destroyed or lost. It becomes productive energy. It reappears in the form of fruitful thought. The virtuous man is always more successful than the vicious man because he is teeming with resources.\r\n\t\t\t4. Originality\r\n\t\t\t\tOriginality is resourcefulness ripened and perfected. Where there is originality there is genius, and men of genius are the lights of the world. Whatever work a man does, he should fall back upon his own resources in the doing it. While learning from others, he should not slavishly imitate them, but should put himself into his work, and so make it new and original. \r\n\tThird pillar – Integrity\r\n\t\tThe man that courts prosperity must, in all his transactions, whether material or mental, study how to give a just return for that which he receives. \r\n\t\tThe Pillar of Integrity is held together by these four virile elements:\r\n\t\t\t1. Honesty\r\n\t\t\t\tHonesty is the surest way to success. The day at last comes when the dishonest man repents in sorrow and suffering: but not man ever needs to repent of having been honest. Even when the honest man fails – as he does sometimes, through lacking other of these pillars, such as energy, economy, or system his failure is not the grievous thing it is to the dishonest man, for he can always rejoice in the fact that he has never defrauded a fellow being. Even in his darkest hour he finds repose in a clear conscience.\r\n\t\t\t2. Fearlessness\r\n\t\t\t\tFearlessness accompanies honesty. The honest man has a clear eye and an unflinching gaze. He looks his fellowmen in the face, and his speech is direct and convincing. The liar and cheat hangs his head; his eye is muddy and his gaze oblique. He cannot look another man in the eye, and his speech arouses mistrust, for it is ambiguous and unconvincing.\r\n\t\t\t3. Purposefulness\r\n\t\t\t\tPurposefulness is the direct outcome of that strength of character which integrity fosters. The man of integrity is the man of direct aims and strong and intelligent purposes.\r\n\t\t\t4. Invincibility\r\n\t\t\t\tInvincibility is a glorious protector, but it only envelopes the man whose integrity is perfectly pure and unassailable. Never to violate, even in the most insignificant particular, the principle of integrity, is to be invincible against all the assaults of innuendo, slander, and misrepresentation. \r\n\tFourth pillar – System\r\n\t\tSystem is that principle of order by which confusion is rendered impossible. In the natural and universal order everything is in its place, so that the vast universe runs more perfectly than the most perfect machine. Disorder in space would mean the destruction of the universe; and disorder in a man’s affairs destroys his work and his prosperity.\r\n\t\tIn system is contained these four ingredients:\r\n\t\t\t1. Readiness\r\n\t\t\t\tReadiness is aliveness. It is that spirit of alertness by which a situation is immediately grasped and dealt with. The observance of system fosters and develops this spirit. The successful General must have the power of readily meeting any new and unlooked for move on the part of the enemy; so every business man must have the readiness to deal with any unexpected development affecting his line of trade; and so also must the man of thought be able to deal with the details of any new problems which may arise. \r\n\t\t\t2. Accuracy\r\n\t\t\t\tAccuracy is of supreme importance in all commercial concerns and enterprises, but there can be no accuracy apart from system, and a system which is more or less imperfect will involve its originator in mistakes more or less disastrous until he improves it.\r\n\t\t\t3. Utility\r\n\t\t\t\tUtility or usefulness, is the direct result of method in one’s work. Labour arrives at fruitful and profitable ends when it is systematically pursued. If the gardener is to gather in the best produce, he must not only sow and plant, but he must sow and plant at the right time; and if any work is to be fruitful in results, it must be done seasonably, and the time for doing a thing must not be allowed to pass by.\r\n\t\t\t4. Comprehensiveness\r\n\t\t\t\tComprehensiveness is that quality of mind which enables a man to deal with a large number of related details, to grasp them in their entirety, along with the single principle which governs them and binds them together. It is a masterly quality, giving organizing and governing power, and is developed by systematic attention to details. \r\n\tFifth pillar – Sympathy\r\n\t\tSympathy is a deep, silent, inexpressible tenderness which is shown in a consistently self forgetful gentle character. Sympathetic people are not gushing and spasmodic, but are permanently self restrained, firm, quiet, unassuming and gracious. Lack of sympathy arises in egotism; sympathy arises in love. Egotism is involved in ignorance; love is allied to knowledge.\r\n\t\tFourfold are the qualities which make up the great virtue of sympathy, namely:\r\n\t\t\t1. Kindness\r\n\t\t\t\tKindness, when fully developed, is not a passing impulse but a permanent quality.\r\n\t\t\t\tA true kindness is unchangeable, and needs no external stimulus to force it into action.\r\n\t\t\t2. Generosity\r\n\t\t\t\tGenerosity goes with a larger hearted kindness. If kindness be the gentle sister, Generosity is the strong brother. A free, open handed, and magnanimous character is always attractive and influential.\r\n\t\t\t3. Gentleness\r\n\t\t\t\tGentleness is akin to divinity. Perhaps no quality is so far removed from all that is coarse, brutal and selfish as gentleness, so that when one is becoming gentle, he is becoming divine. It can only be acquired after much experience and through great self-discipline. \r\n\t\t\t4. Insight\r\n\t\t\t\tInsight is the gift of sympathy. The sympathetic mind is the profoundly perceiving mind. We understand by experience, and not by argument.\r\n\t\tPrejudice is the great barrier to sympathy and knowledge. It is impossible to understand those against whom one harbours a prejudice. We only see men and things as they are when we divest our minds of partial judgements. We become seers as we become sympathizers. Sympathy has knowledge for her companion.\r\n\tSixth pillar – Sincerity\r\n\t\tHuman society is held together by its sincerity. A universal falseness would beget a universal mistrust which would bring about a universal separation, if not destruction. Life is made sane, wholesome, and happy, by our deep rooted belief in one another. If we did not trust men, we could not transact business with them, could not even associate with them.\r\n\t\tFour beautiful traits adorn the mind of the sincere man; they are:\r\n\t\t\t1. Simplicity\r\n\t\t\t\tSimplicity is naturalness. It is simple being, without fake or foreign adornment. \r\n\t\t\t2. Attractiveness\r\n\t\t\t\tAttractiveness is the direct outcome of simplicity. This is seen in the attractiveness of all natural objects; to which we have referred, but in human nature it is manifested as personal influence.\r\n\t\t\t3. Penetration\r\n\t\t\t\tPenetration belongs to the sincere. All shams are unveiled in their presence. All simulators are transparent to the searching eye of the sincere man. With one clear glance he sees through all their flimsy pretences. Tricksters with under his strong gaze, and want to get away from it. He who has rid his heart of all falseness, and entertains only that which is true, has gained the power to distinguish the false from the true in others. He is not deceived who is not self deceived.\r\n\t\t\t4. Power\r\n\t\t\t\tPower goes with penetration. An understanding of the nature of actions is accompanied with the power to meet and deal with all actions in the right and best way.\r\n\tSeventh pillar – Impartiality\r\n\t\tTo get rid of prejudice is a great achievement. Prejudices piles obstacles in a man’s way – obstacles to health, success, happiness, and prosperity, so that he is continually running up against imaginary enemies, who, when prejudice is removed, are seen to be friend.\r\n\t\tThe four great elements of impartiality are:\r\n\t\t\t1. Justice\r\n\t\t\t\tThe just man does not try to gain an advantage; he considers the true values of things, and moulds his transactions in accordance therewith. \r\n\t\t\t\tThe upright man purges his business of all bargaining, and builds it one the more dignified basis of justice. He supplies “a good article” at its right price, and does not alter. He does not soil his hands with any business which is tainted with fraud. His goods are genuine and they are properly priced.\r\n\t\t\t2. Patience\r\n\t\t\t\tPatience is the brightest jewel in the character of the impartial man.\r\n\t\t\t\tA man must begin to wisely control himself, and to learn the beautiful lessons of patience, if he is to be highly prosperous, if he is to be a man of use and power. He must learn to think of others, to act for their good, and not alone for himself; to be considerate, for bearing, and long suffering. \r\n\t\t\t3. Calmness\r\n\t\t\t\tCalmness accompanies patience. It is a great and glorious quality. It is the peaceful haven of emancipated souls after their long wanderings on the tempest riven ocean of passion. It makes the man who has suffered much, endured much, experienced much, and has finally conquered.\r\n\t\t\t4. Wisdom\r\n\t\t\t\tWisdom abides with the impartial man. Her counsels guide him; her wings shield him; she leads him along pleasant ways to happy destinations.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe understanding mind needs no external support. It stands of itself on the firm ground of knowledge; not book-knowledge, but ripened experience. It has passed through all minds, and therefore knows them. It has traveled with all hearts, and knows their journeying in joy and sorrow.\r\n\tEighth pillar – Self-reliance\r\n\t\tIf we rely upon the light of another, darkness will over take us, but if we rely upon our own light we have but to keep it burning. \r\n\t\tThe four grand qualities of self reliance are:\r\n\t\t\t1. Decision\r\n\t\t\t\tDecision makes a man strong. The wearer is the weakling. A man who is to play a speaking part, however small, in the drama of life must be decisive and know what he is about.\r\n\t\t\t2. Steadfastness\r\n\t\t\t\tSteadfastness arises in the mind that is quick to decide. It is indeed a final decision upon the best course of conduct and the best path in life.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe man without fixed principles will not accomplish much.\r\n\t\t\t3. Dignity\r\n\t\t\t\tDignity clothes, as with a majestic garment, the steadfast mind.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe man of dignity cannot be down-trodden and enslaved, because he has ceased to tread upon and enslave himself. He at once disarms, with a look, a word, a wise and suggestive silence, any attempt to demean him.\r\n\t\t\t4. Independence\r\n\t\t\t\tIndependence is the birthright of the strong and well controlled man. All men love and strive for liberty. All men aspire to some sort of freedom.",

Dignity\r\n\t\t\t\tDignity clothes, as with a majestic garment, the steadfast mind.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe man of dignity cannot be down-trodden and enslaved, because he has ceased to tread upon and enslave himself. He at once disarms, with a look, a word, a wise and suggestive silence, any attempt to demean him.\r\n\t\t\t4. Independence\r\n\t\t\t\tIndependence is the birthright of the strong and well controlled man. All men love and strive for liberty. All men aspire to some sort of freedom."

      "text": "The Law of Success: \nUsing the Power of Spirit to Create \nHealth, Prosperity, and Happiness\nParamahansa Yogananda\r\n\tIntroduction\r\n\t\tIs there a power that can reveal hidden veins of riches and uncover treasures of which we never dreamed? Is there a force that we can call upon to give health, happiness, and spiritual enlightenment? The saints and sages of India teach that there is such a power. They have demonstrated the efficacy of truth principles that will work for you, too, if you give them a fair trial.\r\n\t\tYour success in life does not altogether depend on ability and training; it also depends on your determination to grasp opportunities that are presented to you. Opportunities in life come by creation, not by chance. You yourself, either now or in the past (including the past of former lives), have created all opportunities that arise in your path. Since you have earned them, use them to the best advantage.\r\n\t\tIf you use all available outward means, as well as your natural abilities, to overcome every obstacle in your path, you will thus develop the powers that God gave you — unlimited powers that flow from the innermost forces of your being. You possess the power of thought and the power of will. Utilize to the uttermost these divine gifts!\r\n\tThought\r\n\t\tYou Can Control Destiny\r\n\t\t\tMind is the creator of everything. You should therefore guide it to create only good. If you cling to a certain thought with dynamic will power, it finally assumes a tangible outward form. When you are able to employ your will always for constructive purposes, you become the controller of your destiny.\r\n\t\tThe Power of Thought\r\n\t\t\tYou demonstrate success or failure according to your habitual trend of thought. In you which is the stronger — success thoughts or failure thoughts? If your mind is ordinarily in a negative state, an occasional positive thought is not sufficient to attract success. But if you think rightly, you will find your goal even though you seem to be enveloped in darkness.\r\n\t\tFear Exhausts Life Energy\r\n\t\t\tFear exhausts life energy; it is one of the greatest enemies of dynamic will power. Fear causes the life force that ordinarily flows steadily through the nerves to be squeezed out, and the nerves themselves to become as though paralyzed; the vitality of the whole body is lowered. Fear doesn’t help you to get away from the object of fear; it only weakens your will power. Fear causes the brain to send an inhibiting message to all bodily organs.\r\n\t\tFailures Should Arouse Determination\r\n\t\t\tEven failures should act as stimulants to your will power and to your material and spiritual growth. When you have failed in any project it is helpful to analyze every factor in the situation in order to eliminate all chances in the future that you might repeat the same errors.\r\n\t\tThe Need For Self-Analysis\r\n\t\t\tAnother secret of progress is self-analysis. Introspection is a mirror in which to see recesses of your mind that otherwise would remain hidden from you. Diagnose your failures and sort out your good and bad tendencies. Analyze what you are, what you wish to become, and what shortcomings are impeding you.\r\n\tWill\r\n\t\tWill Is the Dynamo\r\n\t\t\tAlong with positive thinking, you should use will power and continuous activity in order to be successful. Every outward manifestation is the result of will, but this power is not always used consciously. There is mechanical will as well as conscious will. The dynamo of all your powers is volition, or will power. Without volition you cannot walk, talk, work, think, or feel. Therefore will power is the spring of all your actions. (In order not to use this energy, you would have to be completely inactive both physically and mentally. Even when you move your hand, you are using will power. It is impossible to live without using this force.)\r\n\t\tThe Creative Power of Initiative\r\n\t\t\tWhat is initiative? It is a creative faculty within you, a spark of the Infinite Creator. It may give you the power to create something no one else has ever created. It urges you to do things in new ways. The accomplishments of a person of initiative may be as spectacular as a shooting star. Apparently creating something from nothing, he demonstrates that the seemingly impossible may become possible by one’s employment of the great inventive power of the Spirit.\r\n\t\tHabits of Though Control One's Life\r\n\t\t\tWeaken a bad habit by avoiding everything that occasioned it or stimulated it, without concentrating upon it in your zeal to avoid it.

      "originalText": "The Law of Success: \nUsing the Power of Spirit to Create \nHealth, Prosperity, and Happiness\nParamahansa Yogananda\r\n\tIntroduction\r\n\t\tIs there a power that can reveal hidden veins of riches and uncover treasures of which we never dreamed? Is there a force that we can call upon to give health, happiness, and spiritual enlightenment? The saints and sages of India teach that there is such a power. They have demonstrated the efficacy of truth principles that will work for you, too, if you give them a fair trial.\r\n\t\tYour success in life does not altogether depend on ability and training; it also depends on your determination to grasp opportunities that are presented to you. Opportunities in life come by creation, not by chance. You yourself, either now or in the past (including the past of former lives), have created all opportunities that arise in your path. Since you have earned them, use them to the best advantage.\r\n\t\tIf you use all available outward means, as well as your natural abilities, to overcome every obstacle in your path, you will thus develop the powers that God gave you — unlimited powers that flow from the innermost forces of your being. You possess the power of thought and the power of will. Utilize to the uttermost these divine gifts!\r\n\tThought\r\n\t\tYou Can Control Destiny\r\n\t\t\tMind is the creator of everything. You should therefore guide it to create only good. If you cling to a certain thought with dynamic will power, it finally assumes a tangible outward form. When you are able to employ your will always for constructive purposes, you become the controller of your destiny.\r\n\t\tThe Power of Thought\r\n\t\t\tYou demonstrate success or failure according to your habitual trend of thought. In you which is the stronger — success thoughts or failure thoughts? If your mind is ordinarily in a negative state, an occasional positive thought is not sufficient to attract success. But if you think rightly, you will find your goal even though you seem to be enveloped in darkness.\r\n\t\tFear Exhausts Life Energy\r\n\t\t\tFear exhausts life energy; it is one of the greatest enemies of dynamic will power. Fear causes the life force that ordinarily flows steadily through the nerves to be squeezed out, and the nerves themselves to become as though paralyzed; the vitality of the whole body is lowered. Fear doesn’t help you to get away from the object of fear; it only weakens your will power. Fear causes the brain to send an inhibiting message to all bodily organs.\r\n\t\tFailures Should Arouse Determination\r\n\t\t\tEven failures should act as stimulants to your will power and to your material and spiritual growth. When you have failed in any project it is helpful to analyze every factor in the situation in order to eliminate all chances in the future that you might repeat the same errors.\r\n\t\tThe Need For Self-Analysis\r\n\t\t\tAnother secret of progress is self-analysis. Introspection is a mirror in which to see recesses of your mind that otherwise would remain hidden from you. Diagnose your failures and sort out your good and bad tendencies. Analyze what you are, what you wish to become, and what shortcomings are impeding you.\r\n\tWill\r\n\t\tWill Is the Dynamo\r\n\t\t\tAlong with positive thinking, you should use will power and continuous activity in order to be successful. Every outward manifestation is the result of will, but this power is not always used consciously. There is mechanical will as well as conscious will. The dynamo of all your powers is volition, or will power. Without volition you cannot walk, talk, work, think, or feel. Therefore will power is the spring of all your actions. (In order not to use this energy, you would have to be completely inactive both physically and mentally. Even when you move your hand, you are using will power. It is impossible to live without using this force.)\r\n\t\tThe Creative Power of Initiative\r\n\t\t\tWhat is initiative? It is a creative faculty within you, a spark of the Infinite Creator. It may give you the power to create something no one else has ever created. It urges you to do things in new ways. The accomplishments of a person of initiative may be as spectacular as a shooting star. Apparently creating something from nothing, he demonstrates that the seemingly impossible may become possible by one’s employment of the great inventive power of the Spirit.\r\n\t\tHabits of Though Control One's Life\r\n\t\t\tWeaken a bad habit by avoiding everything that occasioned it or stimulated it, without concentrating upon it in your zeal to avoid it. Then divert your mind to some good habit and steadily cultivate it until it becomes a dependable part of you.\r\n\t\tThe Way of Meditation\r\n\t\t\tBy the power of concentration and meditation you can direct the inexhaustible power of your mind to accomplish what you desire and to guard every door against failure. All successful men and women devote much time to deep concentration. They are able to dive deeply within their minds and to find the pearls of right solutions for the problems that confront them. If you learn how to withdraw your attention from all objects of distraction and to place it upon one object of concentration, you too will know how to attract at will whatever you need.\r\n\t\tPower of Divine Will\r\n\t\t\tDivine Will has no boundaries; it works through laws known and unknown, natural and seemingly miraculous. It can change the course of destiny, wake the dead, cast mountains into the sea, and create new solar systems.\n\nMan, as an image of God, possesses within him that all-accomplishing power of will. To discover through right meditation1 how to be in harmony with the Divine Will is man’s highest obligation.\r\n\tAbundance\r\n\t\tSuccess Is Measured by Happiness\r\n\t\t\tConsider whether fulfillment of the goal you have chosen will constitute success.

Your belief may be\nfalse or correct, according to the soundness or unsoundness, truth or\nfalsity, of those sense impressions.\r\n\t\tBy controlling four sources, the ideal of a nation or a people can be\ncompletely changed, or even supplanted by a new ideal, in one\ngeneration. These four sources are: (1) the home teachings, (2) the\nchurch teachings, (3) the public school teachings, and (4) the newspapers,\nmagazines, and books.\r\n\tLesson #5: The Power of Your Mind\r\n\t\tThe human mind is a composite of many qualities and tendencies. It consists of likes and dislikes, optimism and pessimism, hatred and love, constructiveness and destructiveness, kindness and cruelty. The mind is made up of all these qualities and more. It is a blending of them all, some minds showing one of these qualities\ndominating and other minds showing others dominating.\r\n\t\tThe dominating qualities are largely determined by one’s environ- ment, training, and associates, and particularly by one’s own thoughts! Any thought held constantly in the mind, or any thought dwelt upon through concentration and brought into the conscious mind often, attracts to it those qualities of the human mind which it most resembles.\r\n\t\tLearn something about that wonderful machine which we call the human mind. It is your real source of power. If you are ever to free yourself of petty worries and financial want, it will be through the efforts of that wonderful mind of yours.\r\n\t\tThe man who goes about with a chip on his shoulder finds a dozen people a day who take delight in knocking it off, a fact to which you can easily subscribe if you have ever tried going about with a chip on your shoulder. You need no proof that the man who carries a smile on his face and who always has a word of kindness for everyone he meets is universally liked, while the opposite type is just as generally disliked.\r\n\tLesson #6: How to Build Self-Confidence\r\n\t\t\nA careful analysis of the successful men of the world shows that the dominating quality which they all possessed was self-confidence.\r\n\t\tTry as hard as you wish, and you cannot be happy unless you believe in yourself! Work with all the strength at your command, and you cannot accumulate more than barely enough to live on unless you believe in yourself!\r\n\t\tIn the development of self-confidence, one of the first steps you must take is to dispel forever the feeling that you cannot accomplish anything you undertake. Fear is the chief negative that stands between you and self-confidence, but we shall show you how to scientifically eliminate fear and develop courage in its place.\r\n\t\tAffirmations: (Faith is the foundation upon which civilization rests. Nothing seems impossible when built upon faith as the cornerstone to your self-confidence building.)\r\n\t\t\tI know that I have the ability to accomplish all that I undertake.I know that to succeed, I have only to establish this belief in myself and follow it with vigorous, aggressive action. I will establish it.\r\n\t\t\tI realize that my thoughts eventually reproduce themselves in material form and substance and become real in the physical state. Therefore, I will concentrate upon the daily task of thinking of the person I intend to be and of drawing a mental picture of this person and of transforming this picture into reality. (Here describe in detail your ‘‘chief aim’’ or the life-work\nyou have selected.)\r\n\t\t\tI am studying with the firm intention of mastering the funda-\nmental principles through which I may attract to me the desirable things of life. Through this study, I am becoming more self-reliant and more cheerful. I am developing more sympathy for my fellow men, and I am becoming stronger, both mentally and physically. I am learning to smile the smile that plays upon the heart as well as upon the lips.\r\n\t\t\tI am mastering and overpowering the habit of starting some- thing that I do not finish. From this time forward, I will first plan all that I wish to do, making a clear mental picture of it, and then I will let nothing interfere with my plans until I have developed them into realities.\r\n\t\t\tI have clearly mapped out and planned the work that I intend to follow for the ensuing five years. I have set a price upon my services for each of the five years, a price that I intend to command through strict application of the principle of efficient, satisfactory service!\r\n\t\t\tI fully realize that genuine success will come only through strict application of the ‘‘Golden Rule’’ principles. I will, therefore, engage in no transaction which does not benefit alike all who participate in it. I will succeed by attracting to me the forces that I wish to use. I will induce others to serve me because of my willingness to serve them. I will gain the friendship of my fellow men because of my kindness and my willingness to be a friend. I will eliminate from my mind fear by developing in its place courage. I will eliminate skepticism by developing faith. I will eliminate hatred and cynicism by developing love for humanity.\r\n\t\t\tI will learn to stand upon my feet and express myself in clear, concise, and simple language, and to speak with force and enthusiasm, in a matter that will carry conviction. I will cause others to become interested in me, because I will first become interested in them. I will eliminate selfishness and develop in its place the spirit of service.\r\n\tLesson #7: Environment and Habit\r\n\t\tEnvironment: The human mind has a decided tendency to absorb the environment with which we are surrounded, and to cause bodily activity which harmonizes with and is appropriate to that environ- ment. The mind feeds on and grows to resemble the sense impres- sions which it absorbs from the environment in which we live. The mind resembles a chameleon in that it changes its color to correspond to its environment. None but the strongest minds will resist the tendency to absorb the surrounding environment.\r\n\t\t\tEvery word uttered within your hearing, every sight that reaches your eyes, and every sense impression that you receive in any other manner influences your thought as surely as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west! \r\n\t\t\tThe mind feeds upon that which we supply it through our environment; therefore, let us select our environment with the direct object of supplying the mind with suitable material out of which to carry on its work of realizing our ‘‘chief aim.’’\r\n\t\t\tYour daily associates constitute the most important and influential part of your environment for either your progress or your retrogres- sion. It will be of much benefit to you to select, as your associates, people who are in sympathy with your aims and ideals, and whose mental attitude inspires you with enthusiasm, determination, and ambition. \r\n\t\t\tThe clothes you wear influence you; thereby, they form a part of your environment. Soiled or shabby clothes depress you and lower your self-confidence, while clean, modest, and refined clothes give you a sort of inner feeling of courage that causes you to quicken your step as you walk.\r\n\t\t\tWe can rise above and beyond a negative physical environment by creating in our imagination a positive one, or by shutting out all thought of it altogether, but a negative mental environment cannot be dodged—it must be rebuilt. Out of our mental environment, we create every impulse to bodily action; therefore, if our muscular, bodily activities are wisely directed, they must emanate from a sound mental environment. Hence, we claim that as between the mental and physical environments, the former is of greater importance.\r\n\t\tHabit: Habit grows out of environment—out of doing the same thing in the same way repeatedly—out of thinking the same thoughts over and over—and when once formed, it resembles cement which has set in the molds and is hard to break.\r\n\t\t\tThe following rules will help you in your work in forming new habits:\r\n\t\t\t\t1. At the beginning of the formation of a new habit, put force into your expression of the action, thought, or characteristic. Remember that you are taking the first steps toward making the new mental path, and it is much harder at the first than it will be afterwards. Make the path as clear and deep as you can at the start, so that you can see it readily the next time you wish to travel it.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. Keep your attention firmly concentrated on the new path building, and keep your eyes and thoughts away from the old paths, lest you incline toward them. Forget all about the old paths, and concern yourself only with the new one that you are building.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Travel over your newly made path as often as possible. Make opportunities for doing so, without waiting for them to arise. The oftener you go over the new path, the sooner will it become an old, well-worn, easily traveled one. Think out plans for passing over it and using it at the start.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Resist the temptation to travel over the older, easier paths that you have been using in the past. Every time you resist a temptation, the stronger do you become, and the easier will it be for you to do so the next time. But every time you yield to the temptation, the easier does it become to yield again, and the more difficult does it become to resist the next time. You will have a fight on at the start, and this is the critical time. Prove your determination, persistency, and willpower now, right here at the start.\r\n\t\t\t\t5. Be sure that you have mapped out the proper path—plan it out well, and see where it will lead you to—then go ahead without fear and without allowing yourself to doubt. ‘Place your hand upon the plow, and look not backward.’ Select your goal—then make a good, deep, wide mental path leading straight to it.’’\r\n\t\t\nPersistence may be compared to the ‘‘drop of water which finally wears away the hardest stone.’’ When the final chapter of your life- work is written, you will find that your persistence, or lack of it, has played a mighty part for your success or failure.\r\n\tLesson #10: Persuasion versus Force\r\n\t\tThe human body can be imprisoned or controlled by physical force, but not so with the human mind. No man on earth can control the mind of a normal, healthy person if that person chooses to exercise his God-given right to control his mind.\r\n\t\tYou can never get the maximum, or even a fair average of constructive action out of your mind until you have learned to control it and keep it from becoming stimulated through anger or fear!",

No man on earth can control the mind of a normal, healthy person if that person chooses to exercise his God-given right to control his mind.\r\n\t\tYou can never get the maximum, or even a fair average of constructive action out of your mind until you have learned to control it and keep it from becoming stimulated through anger or fear!"

      "text": "Man's Search For Himself\nDr. Rollo May\r\n\tThe Predicament\r\n\t\tEmptiness\r\n\t\t\tIt may sound surprising when I say, on the basis of my own clinical practice as well as that of my psychological and psychiatric colleagues, that the chief problem of people in the middle decade of the twentieth century is emptiness.\r\n\t\t\tAs Freud made clear, the desire was there; the chief thing necessary was to clear up the repressions, bring the desire into consciousness, and eventually help the patient to become able to gratify his desire in accord with reality.\r\n\t\t\tThe experience of emptiness, rather, generally comes from people’s feeling that they are powerless to do anything effective about their lives or the world they live in.\r\n\t\tLoneliness\r\n\t\t\tAnother characteristic of modern people is loneliness. \n\nThey describe this feeling as one of being “on the outside,” isolated, or, if they are sophisticated, they say that they feel alienated.\r\n\t\t\tThe feelings of emptiness and loneliness go together. \n\nThe reasons for the close relation between loneliness and emptiness are not difficult to discover. \n\nFor when a person does not know with any inner conviction what he wants or what he feels; when, in a period of traumatic change, he becomes aware of the fact that the conventional desires and goals he has been taught to follow no longer bring him any security or give him any sense of direction, when, that is, he feels an inner void while he stands amid the outer confusion of upheaval in his society, he senses danger; and his natural reaction is to look around for other people.\r\n\t\tAnxiety\r\n\t\t\tAnxiety, the other characteristic of modern man, is even more basic than emptiness and loneliness. \n\nFor being “hollow” and lonely would not bother us except that it makes us prey to that peculiar psychological pain and turmoil called anxiety.\r\n\t\t\tIt is the quality of an experience which makes it anxiety rather than the quantity. \n\nIn its full-blown intensity, anxiety is the most painful emotion to which the human animal is heir. \n\n“Present dangers are less than future imaginings,” as Shakespeare puts it; and people have been known to leap out of a lifeboat and drown rather than face the greater agony of continual doubt and uncertainty, never knowing whether they will be rescued or not.\r\n\t\tThis is what anxiety does to the human being: it disorients him, wiping out temporarily his clear knowledge of what and who he is, and blurring his view of reality around him.\r\n\t\tThe positive and hopeful side is that just as anxiety destroys our self-awareness, so awareness of ourselves can destroy anxiety. \n\nThat is to say, the stronger our consciousness of ourselves, the more we can take a stand against and overcome anxiety.\r\n\t\tOur task, then, is to strengthen our consciousness of ourselves, to find centers of strength within ourselves which will enable us to stand despite the confusion and bewilderment around us. \n\nThis is the central purpose of the inquiry in this book.\r\n\tStrengthen our consciousness of ourselves\r\n\t\tTO undertake this “venture of becoming aware of ourselves,” and to discover the sources of inner strength and security which are the rewards of such a venture, let us start at the beginning by asking, What is this person, this sense of selfhood we seek?\r\n\t\tMan’s consciousness of himself is the source of his highest qualities. \n\nIt underlies his ability to distinguish between “I” and the world. It gives him the capacity to keep time, which is simply the ability to stand outside the present and to imagine oneself back in yesterday or ahead in the day after tomorrow. \n\nThus human beings can learn from the past and plan for the future.\r\n\t\tThis consciousness of self, this capacity to see one’s self as though from the outside, is the distinctive characteristic of man.\r\n\t\tThis capacity for consciousness of ourselves gives us the ability to see ourselves as others see us and to have empathy with others. \n\nIt underlies our remarkable capacity to transport ourselves into someone else’s parlor where we\nwill be in reality next week, and then in imagination to think and plan how we will act. \n\nAnd it enables us to imagine ourselves in someone else’s place, and to ask how we would feel and what we would do if we were this other person.\r\n\t\t4 Stages in Consciousness of Self\r\n\t\t\tThe first is that of the innocence of the infant before consciousness of self is born.\r\n\t\t\tThe second is the stage of rebellion, when the person is trying to become free to establish some inner strength in his own right. \n\nThis stage is most clearly seen in the child of two or three or the adolescent, and may involve defiance and hostility.\n\n In greater or lesser degree rebellion is a necessary transition as one cuts old ties and seeks to make new ones. But rebellion is not to be confused with freedom.\r\n\t\t\tThe third stage we may call the ordinary consciousness of self. In this stage a person can to some extent see his errors, make some allowance for his prejudices, use his guilt feelings and anxiety as experiences to learn from, and make his decisions with some responsibility. \n\nThis is what most people mean when they speak of a healthy state of personality.\r\n\t\t\tBut there is a fourth stage of consciousness which is extraordinary in the sense that most individuals experience it only rarely. This stage is most clearly illustrated when one gets a sudden insight into a problem—abruptly, seemingly from nowhere, pops up an answer for which one has struggled in vain for days. \n\nSometimes such insights come in dreams, or at moments of reverie when one is thinking about something else: in any case, we know that the answer emerges from what are called subconscious levels in the personality. \n\nSuch consciousness may occur in scientific, religious or artistic activity alike; it is sometimes popularly called “dawning” of ideas or “inspiration.” As all students of creative activity make clear, this level of consciousness is present in all creative work. \"Creative consciousness of self.\"\n\nThe classical psychological term for this awareness is ecstasy. The word literally means “to stand outside one’s self,” that is, to catch a view of, or experience something, from a perspective outside one’s usual limited viewpoint.\r\n\tReal love and Freedom\r\n\t\tNo one can arrive at real love or morality or freedom until he has frankly confronted and worked through his resentment. \n\nHatred and resentment should be used as motivations to re-establish one’s genuine freedom: one will not transform those destructive emotions into constructive ones until he does this. And the first step is to know whom or what one hates.\r\n\t\tFreedom is man’s capacity to take a hand in his own development. It is our capacity to mold ourselves. Freedom is the other side of consciousness of self: if we were not able to be aware of ourselves, we would be pushed along by instinct or the automatic march of history\r\n\t\t\tBut by our power to be conscious of ourselves, we can call to mind how we acted yesterday or last month, and by learning from these actions we can influence, even if ever so little, how we act today.\r\n\t\t\tConsciousness of self gives us the power to stand outside the rigid chain of stimulus and response, to pause, and by this pause to throw some weight on either side, to cast some decision about what the response will be.\r\n\t\t\tThat consciousness of self and freedom go together is shown in the fact that the less self-awareness a person has, the more he is unfree. That is to say, the more he is controlled by inhibitions, repressions, childhood conditionings which he has consciously “forgotten” but which still drive him unconsciously, the more he is pushed by forces over which he has no control.\r\n\t\tPsychotherapy\r\n\t\t\tWhen persons first come for psychotherapeutic help, for example, they generally complain that they are “driven” in any number of ways: they have sudden anxieties or fears or are blocked in studying or working without any appropriate reason. \n\nThey are unfree —that is, bound and pushed by unconscious patterns.\r\n\t\t\tIt may be after some months of psychotherapeutic work little changes begin to appear. \n\nThe person begins to recall his dreams regularly; or in one session he takes the initiative in stating that he wants to change the subject on hand and get some help on a different problem; or one day he can say that he felt angry when the therapist said such and such; or he is able to cry when previously he never could feel much of anything, or suddenly he laughs with spontaneity and wholeheartedness, or is able to state he doesn’t like Mary with whom he has been conventional friends for years but does like Carolyn. \n\nIn such ways, slight as they may seem, his emerging self-awareness goes hand in hand with his enlarging power to direct his own life.\r\n\t\t\tAs the person gains more consciousness of self, his range of choice and his freedom proportionately increase. Freedom is cumulative; one choice made with an element of freedom makes greater freedom possible for the next choice. \n\nEach exercise of freedom enlarges the circumference of the circle of one’s self.",

Music has a fourth dimensional quality and releases the soul from imprisonment. \n\nIt makes wonderful things seem possible, and easy of accomplishment!\r\n\t3.

Now I no longer baptize children, but I baptize events, but I give every event the same name. \n\nIf I have a failure I baptize it success, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost!\"\r\n\t\tIn this, we see the great law of transmutation, founded on non- resistance. \n\nThrough his spoken word, every failure was transmuted into success.\r\n\t\tMan can only get the right idea of nonresistance, through spiritual understanding. \n\nMy students have often said: \"I don't want to be a door-mat.\" I reply \"When you use nonresistance with wisdom, no one will ever be able to walk over you.\"\r\n\t2. Have faith in your spoken word\r\n\t\tOne of the greatest messages given to the race through the scriptures is that God is man's supply and that man can release, through his spoken word, all that belongs to him by divine right. \n\nHe must, however, have perfect faith in his spoken word.\r\n\t\tWhen man knows his own powers and the workings of his mind, his great desire is to find an easy and quick way to impress the subconscious with good, for simply an intellectual knowledge of the Truth will not bring results.\r\n\t\tThe subconscious is often impressed through music. Music has a fourth dimensional quality and releases the soul from imprisonment. \n\nIt makes wonderful things seem possible, and easy of accomplishment!\r\n\t3. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\r\n\t\t\"Nothing ever happens without an on-looker\" is an ancient saying.\n\nMan sees first his failure or success, his joy or sorrow, before it swings into visibility from the scenes set in his own imagination.\r\n\t\t\tContinually \"making-believe,\" impresses the subconscious.\n\nIf one makes believe he is rich, and makes believe he is successful, in \"due time he will reap.\"\r\n\t\t“To be fully engaged, we must be physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused and spiritually aligned with a purpose beyond our immediate self-interest.”\n\n― The Power of Full Engagement\r\n\t\t\tRemoves inner-resistance\r\n\t\t\tTrains of related thought\r\n\t\t\t“Setting your intent.” If you focus on your goals, your RAS will reveal the people, information and opportunities that help you achieve them.\r\n\t\t\tA story from past\r\n\t\t\t\tTHETA (4-8 Hz)\r\n\t\t\t\tTheta activity is classed as “slow” activity. It is seen in connection with creativity, intuition, daydreaming, and fantasizing.  and is a repository for memories, emotions, sensations. Theta waves are strong during internal focus, meditation, prayer, and spiritual awareness. \n\nIt reflects the state between wakefulness and sleep and relates to the subconscious mind. It is abnormal in awake adults but is perfectly normal in children up to 13 years old. It is also normal during sleep. Theta is believed to reflect activity from the limbic system and hippocampal regions"

      "text": "How to Turn Reactivity into Proactivity\n(Law of Polarity - The Kybalion)\r\n\tLaw of Polarity\r\n\t\t  \"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.\" \n-The Kybalion\r\n\t\tTo illustrate:  Heat and Cold, although \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins!\n\nThere is no such thing as \"absolute heat\" or \"absolute cold\"--the two terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\" is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. -The Kybalion\r\n\tEnvironment and self-image\r\n\t\tSelf-Image\r\n\t\t\tCurrent self-image\r\n\t\t\t\tAccept your current self as an assimilation of the past. Much of which was beyond conscious choice and you can evolve yourself into your \"higher self\"\r\n\t\t\t\tEnvironment, events, knowledge, past experiences and imagination forms the self-image\r\n\t\t\tHigher self-image\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat you truly love\r\n\t\t\t\tHow you were truly meant to live\r\n\t\t\t\tHow you were truly meant to serve others\r\n\t\t\t\tHow you were truly meant to learn and grow\r\n\t\tWhere does reactivity show up?\r\n\t\t\tPurpose or vocation\r\n\t\t\tSocial / Relationships\r\n\t\t\tLearning\r\n\tEvolving \"Reactivity\" Beliefs\r\n\t\tOverwhelm\r\n\t\t\t1.There are more ways available that you could possibly ever need to bring forth what you desire and part of the overwhelm is trying to fit in through a limited scope of known ways.\r\n\t\t\t2. By focusing on what can be done right now and seeing it all the way to completion, what is \"next\" reveals itself to increase clarity.\r\n\t\t\t3. Everything does not to be done right away. Overwhelm leads to unnecessary convolution through identification with it. By setting smaller goals and focusing on what what can be done, we feel less overwhelm.\r\n\t\t\t4. The choices that are right for you is found via your \"inner voice\" conversation.\r\n\t\tDoubt\r\n\t\t\t5. Doubt can represent a wavering faith in the outcome which can be overcome by being in environments that inspire and open your mind up to the possibility of the outcome.\r\n\t\t\t6. Doubt within the self-image is a result of doubt based conversations that have instilled themselves in our self-talk to reveal themselves when we experience certain outer world circumstances.\r\n\t\t\t7. Wisdom is acquired through experience from applying knowledge. Testing your curiosity creates clarity.\r\n\t\t\t8.

Look at your thermometer and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins!\n\nThere is no such thing as \"absolute heat\" or \"absolute cold\"--the two terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\" is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. -The Kybalion\r\n\tEnvironment and self-image\r\n\t\tSelf-Image\r\n\t\t\tCurrent self-image\r\n\t\t\t\tAccept your current self as an assimilation of the past. Much of which was beyond conscious choice and you can evolve yourself into your \"higher self\"\r\n\t\t\t\tEnvironment, events, knowledge, past experiences and imagination forms the self-image\r\n\t\t\tHigher self-image\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat you truly love\r\n\t\t\t\tHow you were truly meant to live\r\n\t\t\t\tHow you were truly meant to serve others\r\n\t\t\t\tHow you were truly meant to learn and grow\r\n\t\tWhere does reactivity show up?\r\n\t\t\tPurpose or vocation\r\n\t\t\tSocial / Relationships\r\n\t\t\tLearning\r\n\tEvolving \"Reactivity\" Beliefs\r\n\t\tOverwhelm\r\n\t\t\t1.There are more ways available that you could possibly ever need to bring forth what you desire and part of the overwhelm is trying to fit in through a limited scope of known ways.\r\n\t\t\t2. By focusing on what can be done right now and seeing it all the way to completion, what is \"next\" reveals itself to increase clarity.\r\n\t\t\t3. Everything does not to be done right away. Overwhelm leads to unnecessary convolution through identification with it. By setting smaller goals and focusing on what what can be done, we feel less overwhelm.\r\n\t\t\t4. The choices that are right for you is found via your \"inner voice\" conversation.\r\n\t\tDoubt\r\n\t\t\t5. Doubt can represent a wavering faith in the outcome which can be overcome by being in environments that inspire and open your mind up to the possibility of the outcome.\r\n\t\t\t6. Doubt within the self-image is a result of doubt based conversations that have instilled themselves in our self-talk to reveal themselves when we experience certain outer world circumstances.\r\n\t\t\t7. Wisdom is acquired through experience from applying knowledge. Testing your curiosity creates clarity.\r\n\t\t\t8. There is always a decision that can be made to release from the doubt to reveal a clearer path.\r\n\t\tImpatience\r\n\t\t\t9. Impatience can be a sign of an excessive need to control rather that to allow.\r\n\t\t\t10.

Power took me to stand in the presence of the Risen Lord. Wearing the Human Form Divine, He embraced me and incorporated me into his body of Infinite Love. Wearing his body of love, I stood before Almighty God who said: \"Time to act.\" Then I was sent back into this world to tell the story of God as the infinite power of the human imagination! \r\n\t\tInfinite power resides in your Imagination. You could be in prison and imagine yourself free. Believing in the reality of your imaginal act, it would make no difference to you how you are released. But when it happens and you find yourself where you imagined you were, you will have tested and recognized the infinite power you are. Imagining, you set yourself free; and when God sets you free, you are free indeed. \r\n\t\tWe are told: 'You are sons of the Most High, all of you.\" (Not just a few, but all of us). \"Nevertheless, you will die like men and fall\"…..into infinite states of consciousness, for states are that into which the sons of the Most High fall. \n\nA state is an attitude of mind, a state of experience with a body of beliefs which you live by. Always expressing a state, you identify yourself with it by saying: \"I am poor or I am rich. I am known or I am unknown. I am wanted or I am unwanted.\" I could go on indefinitely, because there are infinite states into which an individual son of the Most High may fall.\r\n\t\tHow do you get out of a state? Through belief! You must believe in the doctrine. You are told: \"Whatsoever you desire, believe you have received it and you will.\" The precepts of Christ must be accepted literally, for they will be fulfilled literally. Can you believe the precept that believing you have already received your desire will bring it forth in your world? If so, then tonight you can change the things that are happening in your world. And if you can believe and persuade yourself that things are as you want them to be to the point of actually moving into the feeling they are true, they will be felt and seen in your world. You must feel your desires are already realized, that they are already true, for the truth of any concept is known by the feeling of certainty that the thought is true.\r\n\tCharles F. Haanel\r\n\t\tThe world without is a reflection of the world within. What appears without is what has been found within. In the world within may be found infinite Wisdom, infinite Power, and an infinite Supply of all that is necessary, waiting for unfoldment, development and expression. If we recognize these potentialities in the world within, they will take form in the world without.\r\n\t\tWe are related to the world within by the subconscious mind. The solar plexus is the organ of this mind; the sympathetic system of nerves presides over all subjective sensations, such as joy, fear, love, emotion, respiration, imagination, and all other subconscious phenomena. It is through the subconscious that we are connected with the Universal Mind and brought into relation with the Infinite constructive forces of the Universe.\r\n\t\tIt is the coordination of these two centers of our being, and the understanding of their functions, which is the great secret of life. With this knowledge we can bring the objective and subjective minds into conscious cooperation and thus coordinate the finite and the infinite. Our future is entirely within our own control. It is not at the mercy of any capricious or uncertain external power.\r\n\t\tRecognition is a mental process, mental action is therefore the interaction of the individual upon the Universal Mind, and as the Universal Mind is the intelligence which pervades all space and animates all living things, this mental action and reaction is the law of causation, but the principle of causation does not obtain in the individual but in the Universal Mind. It is not an objective faculty but a subjective process, and the results are seen in an infinite variety of conditions and experiences.\r\n\t\tWhen you find that you are really one with the Infinite power, and when you can consciously realize this power by a practical demonstration of your ability to overcome any adverse condition by the power of your thought, you will have nothing to fear. Fear will have been destroyed and you will have come into possession of your birthright.\r\n\tNapoleon Hill\r\n\t\tThrough a method of procedure, unknown to man, the subconscious mind draws upon the forces of Infinite Intelligence for the power with which it voluntarily transmutes one's desires into their physical equivalent, making use, always of the most practical media by which this end may be accomplished.\r\n\t\tStrange and varied are the ways of life, and stranger still are the ways of Infinite Intelligence, through which men are sometimes forced to undergo all sorts of punishment before discovering their own brains, and their own capacity to create useful ideas through imagination.\r\n\t\tFAITH is the head chemist of the mind. When FAITH is blended with the vibration of thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration, translates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Infinite Intelligence, as in the case of prayer.\r\n\t\tFAITH is the element, the \"chemical\" which, when mixed with prayer, gives one direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.\r\n\t\tIf you fill your mind with FEAR, doubt and unbelief in your ability to connect with, and use the forces of Infinite Intelligence, the law of auto— suggestion will take this spirit of unbelief and use it as a pattern by which your subconscious mind will translate it into its physical equivalent.\r\n\t\tWhen the plans appear, they will probably \"flash\" into your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of an \"inspiration.\" This inspiration may be considered a direct \"telegram,\" or message from Infinite Intelligence. Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as you receive it.\r\n\t\tMan may become the master of himself, and of his environment, because he has the POWER TO INFLUENCE HIS OWN SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, and through it, gain the cooperation of Infinite Intelligence.\r\n\t\tCREATIVE IMAGINATION:— Through the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.

That's your purpose. You are placed in the garden to dress it and to keep it, that only the lovely things grow in the garden of God.\r\n\t\tSo don't judge it, because you are the source of the thing that you are beholding.

If it is founded on a rock of truth and rightness it will stand. \n\nIf not, it is built upon sand and washed into the sea, returning to its native nothingness.\r\n\t\t\tEvery day examine your consciousness and see just what your are preparing for.\r\n\t\t\tUse what you have with wisdom and it opens the way for more to come to you.\r\n\t\tA well-known man, who has become a great power in the financial world, said to a friend, \"I always follow intuition and I am luck incarnate.\"\n\nInspiration (which is divine guidance) is the most important thing in life. \n\nPeople come to Truth meetings for inspiration. I find the right word will start divine activity operating in their affairs.\r\n\tInspiration & Intuition\r\n\t\tFaith is expectancy, \"According to your faith, be it unto you.\"\n\nWe might say, according to your expectancies be it done unto you; so, what are you expecting?\n\nWe hear people say: \"We expect the worst to happen,\" or \"The worst is yet to come.\" They are deliberately inviting the worst to come.\n\nWe hear others say: \"I expect a change for the better.\" They are inviting better conditions into their lives.\n\nChange your expectancies and you change your conditions.\r\n\t\tThe imagination is man's workshop, the scissors of the mind, where he is constantly cutting out the events of his life!\n\nThe superconscious is the realm of inspiration, revelation, illumination and intuition.\r\n\t\t\tYou juggle with the intellect. The intellect would say, \"Times are hard, no activity in real estate. Don't expect anything until the Fall of 1958.\"\n\nWith spiritual law there is only the now. Before you call you are answered, for \"time and space are but a dream,\" and your blessing is there waiting for you to release it by faith and the word.\r\n\t\t\tWe can learn to control our thoughts in the same way, by gentle determination, not force.\n\nWe take an affirmation and repeat it continually, while our thoughts are on the rampage.\n\nWe cannot always control our thoughts, but we can control our words, and repetition impresses the subconscious, and we are then master of the situation.\r\n\t\t\tHundreds of people choosing the wrong gifts because they were not listening to their intuitive leads.\r\n\t\t\t\tNo matter what you are doing, ask for guidance. It saves time and energy and often a lifetime of misery.\r\n\t\t\t\tAll suffering comes from the violation of intuition. Unless intuition builds the house, they labor in vain who build it.\r\n\t\t\t\tGet the habit of hunching, then you will always be on the magic path.\r\n\t\t\t\t\"And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer, and while they\nare yet speaking, I will hear.\"\r\n\t\t\t\tWorking with spiritual law, we are bringing to pass that which already is. In the Universal Mind it is there as an idea, but is crystallized on the external, by a sincere desire.\r\n\t\tIf you are convinced that you are a failure, you will be a failure, until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success.\n\nThis is done by making an affirmation which \"clicks.\"\r\n\t\t\tThe reason it is necessary to make an affirmation is because repetition impresses the subconscious.\r\n\t\t\tEvery day choose the right words, the right thoughts!\r\n\tNon-Resistance\r\n\t\tNon-resistance is an art. When acquired, The World is Yours! So many people are trying to force situations. Your lasting good will never comes through forcing personal will.\r\n\t\t\tThe intuitive person is never undecided, he is given his leads and hunches, and goes boldly ahead, knowing he is on the magic path.\r\n\t\t\tTalk about your affairs as little as possible, and then only to the ones who will give you encouragement and inspiration.\r\n\t\tYour success and happiness in life depend upon the watchman at the gate of your thoughts, sooner or later, crystallize on the external.",

Before you call you are answered, for \"time and space are but a dream,\" and your blessing is there waiting for you to release it by faith and the word.\r\n\t\t\tWe can learn to control our thoughts in the same way, by gentle determination, not force.\n\nWe take an affirmation and repeat it continually, while our thoughts are on the rampage.\n\nWe cannot always control our thoughts, but we can control our words, and repetition impresses the subconscious, and we are then master of the situation.\r\n\t\t\tHundreds of people choosing the wrong gifts because they were not listening to their intuitive leads.\r\n\t\t\t\tNo matter what you are doing, ask for guidance. It saves time and energy and often a lifetime of misery.\r\n\t\t\t\tAll suffering comes from the violation of intuition. Unless intuition builds the house, they labor in vain who build it.\r\n\t\t\t\tGet the habit of hunching, then you will always be on the magic path.\r\n\t\t\t\t\"And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer, and while they\nare yet speaking, I will hear.\"\r\n\t\t\t\tWorking with spiritual law, we are bringing to pass that which already is. In the Universal Mind it is there as an idea, but is crystallized on the external, by a sincere desire.\r\n\t\tIf you are convinced that you are a failure, you will be a failure, until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success.\n\nThis is done by making an affirmation which \"clicks.\"\r\n\t\t\tThe reason it is necessary to make an affirmation is because repetition impresses the subconscious.\r\n\t\t\tEvery day choose the right words, the right thoughts!\r\n\tNon-Resistance\r\n\t\tNon-resistance is an art. When acquired, The World is Yours! So many people are trying to force situations. Your lasting good will never comes through forcing personal will.\r\n\t\t\tThe intuitive person is never undecided, he is given his leads and hunches, and goes boldly ahead, knowing he is on the magic path.\r\n\t\t\tTalk about your affairs as little as possible, and then only to the ones who will give you encouragement and inspiration.\r\n\t\tYour success and happiness in life depend upon the watchman at the gate of your thoughts, sooner or later, crystallize on the external."

My faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time, and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I \n am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money, and I will follow that plan, when it is received.\r\n\t\tSecond. Repeat this program night and morning until you can see, (in your imagination) the money you intend to accumulate.\r\n\t\tThird. Place a written copy of your statement where you can see it night and morning, and read it just before retiring, and upon arising until it has been memorized.\r\n\t\tRemember, as you carry out these instructions, that you are applying the principle of auto-suggestion, for the purpose of giving orders to your subconscious mind. \n\nRemember, also, that your subconscious mind will act upon instructions that are handed over to it in FAITH\r\n\t\tMoods\r\n\t\t\tYou must train yourself to choose the subject of your thinking at any given time, and also to choose the emotional tone, or what we call the mood that colors it. \n\nYes, you can choose your moods. Indeed, if you could not you would have no real control over your life at all. \r\n\t\t\tMoods habitually entertained produce the characteristic disposition of the person concerned, and it is his disposition that finally makes or mars a person's happiness. \r\n\tThe seven days\r\n\t\tMake up your mind to devote one week solely to the task of building a new habit of thought, and during that week let everything in life be unimportant as compared with that. \r\n\t\tIf you will do so, then that week will be the most significant week in your whole life. \n\nIt will literally be the turning' point for you. If you will do so, it is safe to say that your whole life will change for the better. \n\nIn fact, nothing can possibly remain the same. \r\n\t\tThis may be exceedingly difficult for the first few days, but if you persevere you will find that it will become rapidly easier, and it is actually the most interesting experiment that you could possibly make\r\n\t\tFor seven days you must not allow yourself to dwell for a single moment on any kind of negative thought.\n\nYou must watch yourself for a whole week as a cat watches a mouse, and you must not under any pretense allow your mind to dwell on any thought that is not positive, constructive, optimistic, kind. \n\nA week will be enough, because by that time the habit of positive thinking will begin to be established. \r\n\t\tYou may start it any day in the week, and at any time in the day, first thing in the morning, or after breakfast, or after lunch, it does not matter, but once you do start you must go right through for the seven days. \n\nThat is essential. The whole idea is to have seven days of unbroken mental discipline in order to get the mind definitely bent in a new direction once and for all. \r\n\t\tIf you make a false start, or even if you go on well for two or three days and then for any reason \"fall off\" the diet, the thing to do is to drop the scheme altogether for several days, and then to start again afresh. There must be no jumping on and off, as it were. \r\n\t\tFirst of all, what do I mean by negative thinking? Well, a negative thought is any thought of failure, disappointment, or trouble; any thought of criticism, or spite, or jealousy, or condemnation of others, or self-condemnation; any thought of sickness or accident; or, in short, any kind of limitation or pessimistic thinking. \r\n\t\tSecond, you must be quite clear that what this scheme calls for is that you shall not entertain, or dwell upon negative things.\n\nNote this carefully. It is not the thoughts that come to you that matter, but only such of them as you choose to entertain and dwell upon.\n\nIt does not matter what thoughts may come to you provided you do not entertain them. It is the entertaining or dwelling upon them that matters. \r\n\t\tNegative thoughts may come to you all day long.\n\nSome of them will just drift into your mind of their own accord seemingly, and these come to you out of the race mind. Other negative thoughts will be given to you by other people, either in conversation or by their conduct, or you will hear disagreeable news perhaps by letter or telephone, or you will see crimes and disasters announced in the newspaper headings.\n\nThese things, however, do not matter as long as you do not entertain them. \r\n\t\tWhen the negative thought floats into your mind, immediately turn it out and think of something else.\r\n\t\tNegative experiences or conditions will not affect your diet provided that you do not accept them, by fearing them, by believing them, by being indignant or sad about them, or by giving them any power at all. \r\n\t\tIn closing, I want to tell you that people often find that the starting of this diet seems to stir up all sorts of difficulties.\n\nIt seems as though everything begins to go wrong at once. This is really a good sign. It means that things are moving.\n\nSuppose your whole world seems to rock on its foundations. \n\nHold on steadily, let it rock, and when the rocking is over, the picture will have reassembled itself into something much nearer to your heart's desire. \r\n\t\tA closing word of caution: Do not tell anyone else that you are on the diet, or that you intend to go on it. Keep this tremendous project strictly to yourself. \n\nRemember that your soul should be the Secret Place of the Most High. \n\nWhen you have come through the seven days successfully, and secured your demonstration, allow a reasonable' time to elapse to establish the new mentality, and then tell the story to anyone else who you think is likely to be helped by it. \n\nAnd, finally, remember that nothing said or done by anyone else can possibly throw you off the diet. Only your own reaction to the other person's conduct can do that.",

The relationship with mind is reflected on the screen of space.\n\t\t\t2. The subconscious mind reveals ideas, hunches and inspirations to identify with. Shine your like on these diamonds to express them on the screen of space.\n\t\t\t3. As we engage with the screen of space, we express our diamonds unto it. See aspects of the screen of space as your ideal."

      "text": "What To Say When You Talk to Your Self\nNeville Goddard\n\tRobert Dilts Logical Levels of Change\n\t\t\n\tAll is mind\n\t\tThe great secret of success is a controlled inner conversation from premises of fulfilled desire. The only price you pay for success is the giving up of your former conversation which belongs to the Old Man, the unsuccessful man. The time is ripe for many of us to take conscious charge in creating heaven on earth. To consciously and voluntarily use our imagination, to inwardly hear and only say that which is in harmony with our ideal, is actively bringing heaven to earth.\n\t\tWe are told that \"as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\" But do we know that man's thinking follows the tracks laid down in his own inner conversations? To turn the tracks to which he is tied in the direction in which he wants to go, he must put off his former conversation, which is called in the Bible the Old Man, and be renewed in the spirit of his mind. \n\t\tOur individual worlds are self-revelations of our own inner speech. We are told that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof. For by their words they shall be justified, and by their words they shall be condemned.\n\t\tNow you will understand how wise the ancient was when he told us in the Hermetica, \"There are two gifts which God has bestowed upon man alone and on no other mortal creature. These two are Mind and Speech, and the gift of Mind and Speech is equivalent to that of immortality. If a man uses these two gifts rightly, he will differ in nothing from the Immortals. And when he quits his body, Mind and Speech will be his guides, and by them he will be brought into the troop of the gods and the souls that have attained to bliss.\"\n\t\t\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" The Word, said Hermes, is Son, and Mind is Father of the Word. They are not separate one from the other, for life is the union of Word and Mind. You and your inner talking, or Word, are one. If your mind is one with your inner conversations, then to be transformed in mind is to be transformed in conversation.\n\t\tThe transformation of self requires that we meditate on a given phrase, a phrase which implies that our ideal is realized, and inwardly affirm it over and over and over again until we are inwardly affected by its implication, until we are possessed by it. Hold fast to your noble inner convictions or \"conversations.\"\n\tSpeech is the image of mind\n\t\tA man's mental conversations attracts his life. As long as there is no change in his inner talking, the personal history of the man remains the same. To attempt to change the world before we change our inner talking is to struggle against the very nature of things.\n\t\tFor the solution of all problems lies just in this: the Second Man, the Lord from heaven in all of us, is trying to become self-conscious in the body, that he may be about his father's business. What are his labors? To imitate his father, to become master of the Word, master of his inner talking, that he may mold this world of ours into a likeness with the Kingdom of Love.\n\nThe prophet said, \"Be ye imitators of God as dear children.\" How would I imitate God? Well, we are told that God calls things that are not seen as though they were seen, and the unseen becomes seen. \n\t\tThe prophet Samuel said, \"The Lord spoke by me, and his Word was in my tongue.\" If the Lord's Word was in the prophet's tongue, then the Lord's mouth that uttered the Word must be the prophet's mind, for inner conversations originate in the mind and produce little tiny speech movements in the tongue. The prophet is telling us that the mouth of God is the mind of man, that our inner conversations are the Word of God creating life about us as we create it within ourselves.\n\tWord made visible\n\t\tWe abandon ourselves to negative inner talking, yet expect to retain command of life.

      "originalText": "What To Say When You Talk to Your Self\nNeville Goddard\n\tRobert Dilts Logical Levels of Change\n\t\t\n\tAll is mind\n\t\tThe great secret of success is a controlled inner conversation from premises of fulfilled desire. The only price you pay for success is the giving up of your former conversation which belongs to the Old Man, the unsuccessful man. The time is ripe for many of us to take conscious charge in creating heaven on earth. To consciously and voluntarily use our imagination, to inwardly hear and only say that which is in harmony with our ideal, is actively bringing heaven to earth.\n\t\tWe are told that \"as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\" But do we know that man's thinking follows the tracks laid down in his own inner conversations? To turn the tracks to which he is tied in the direction in which he wants to go, he must put off his former conversation, which is called in the Bible the Old Man, and be renewed in the spirit of his mind. \n\t\tOur individual worlds are self-revelations of our own inner speech. We are told that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof. For by their words they shall be justified, and by their words they shall be condemned.\n\t\tNow you will understand how wise the ancient was when he told us in the Hermetica, \"There are two gifts which God has bestowed upon man alone and on no other mortal creature. These two are Mind and Speech, and the gift of Mind and Speech is equivalent to that of immortality. If a man uses these two gifts rightly, he will differ in nothing from the Immortals. And when he quits his body, Mind and Speech will be his guides, and by them he will be brought into the troop of the gods and the souls that have attained to bliss.\"\n\t\t\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" The Word, said Hermes, is Son, and Mind is Father of the Word. They are not separate one from the other, for life is the union of Word and Mind. You and your inner talking, or Word, are one. If your mind is one with your inner conversations, then to be transformed in mind is to be transformed in conversation.\n\t\tThe transformation of self requires that we meditate on a given phrase, a phrase which implies that our ideal is realized, and inwardly affirm it over and over and over again until we are inwardly affected by its implication, until we are possessed by it. Hold fast to your noble inner convictions or \"conversations.\"\n\tSpeech is the image of mind\n\t\tA man's mental conversations attracts his life. As long as there is no change in his inner talking, the personal history of the man remains the same. To attempt to change the world before we change our inner talking is to struggle against the very nature of things.\n\t\tFor the solution of all problems lies just in this: the Second Man, the Lord from heaven in all of us, is trying to become self-conscious in the body, that he may be about his father's business. What are his labors? To imitate his father, to become master of the Word, master of his inner talking, that he may mold this world of ours into a likeness with the Kingdom of Love.\n\nThe prophet said, \"Be ye imitators of God as dear children.\" How would I imitate God? Well, we are told that God calls things that are not seen as though they were seen, and the unseen becomes seen. \n\t\tThe prophet Samuel said, \"The Lord spoke by me, and his Word was in my tongue.\" If the Lord's Word was in the prophet's tongue, then the Lord's mouth that uttered the Word must be the prophet's mind, for inner conversations originate in the mind and produce little tiny speech movements in the tongue. The prophet is telling us that the mouth of God is the mind of man, that our inner conversations are the Word of God creating life about us as we create it within ourselves.\n\tWord made visible\n\t\tWe abandon ourselves to negative inner talking, yet expect to retain command of life. Our present mental conversations do not recede into the past as man believes. They advance into the future to confront us as wasted words.\n\t\tIt is only what is done now that counts, even though its effects may not be visible until tomorrow. We call, not out loud, but by an inner effort of intense attention; to listen attentively, as though you heard, is to create. The events and relationships of life are your Word made visible.\n\t\tEverything in the world bears witness of the use or misuse of man's inner talking.

Man is ever out-picturing that which he is conscious of being. This is the truth that makes man free, for man is always self-imprisoned or self-freed.\r\n\t\tIn the awareness of being all things are possible, he said, “You shall decree a thing and it shall come to pass.” This is his decreeing – rising in consciousness to the naturalness of being the thing desired.\r\n\t\tThe only way to change your expressions of life is to change your consciousness. For consciousness is the reality that eternally solidifies itself in the things round about you.\r\n\t\tThe door is your consciousness.

Man is ever out-picturing that which he is conscious of being. This is the truth that makes man free, for man is always self-imprisoned or self-freed.\r\n\t\tIn the awareness of being all things are possible, he said, “You shall decree a thing and it shall come to pass.” This is his decreeing – rising in consciousness to the naturalness of being the thing desired.\r\n\t\tThe only way to change your expressions of life is to change your consciousness. For consciousness is the reality that eternally solidifies itself in the things round about you.\r\n\t\tThe door is your consciousness.

      "text": "Cosmic Habit Force\nby Napoleon Hill\r\n\tIntroduction\r\n\t\tCosmic habitforce is the law which makes every living creature, every particle of matter subject to the influence of its environment. It can work for you or against you. The choice is yours.\r\n\t\tThe grandest example of cosmic habit force is the operation of the heavens. Stars and planets move with clocklike precision. They don’t collide; they don’t suddenly veer off course. A complex system of gravity and inertia, attraction and repulsion keeps things moving so precisely that for millennia human beings have been able to predict the position of the stars and planets, the timing of eclipses, and the regularity of meteor showers.\r\n\t\tIf your dominating mental habits are thoughts of poverty, then cosmic habitforce will bring about poverty in your life. If your dominating mental habits are of prosperity and peace, cosmic habitforce will bring them about. There is an endless cycle here. Repetition of a habit intensifies it until it becomes an obsession.\r\n\t\tDefiniteness of purpose, backed by the power of cosmic habitforce and enforced by self-discipline and personal initiative, can bring you to the circumstances you want.\r\n\tHow to use Cosmic Habit Force\r\n\t\tStep one. Create a clear mental image of just how much money you want to make. “A lot” is not a good answer. You need a concrete figure or a percentage above your current income.\r\n\t\tStep two. Imagine some of the results of having that money: a new home, sending your daughter to medical school, a comfortable retirement. Doing this clarifies which of the ten basic motives are driving you. The more motives you can associate with making more money, the stronger your push to achieve it\r\n\t\tStep three. Decide how you will earn this extra money. I’ve emphasized again and again that you can’t get something for nothing. You must have a plan.\r\n\t\tStep four. Write out your goal and your plan. Include your motives for making more money. Instead of a statement like “I want to retire in security,” write something like “I want to own my home free and clear of debt; I want to be able to travel and visit my family three times a year.” Set a date for starting and achieving this goal. Sign your plan; make it a contract with yourself.\r\n\t\tStep five. Go back to your plan, and underline all the things that you need to do to make it happen that you aren’t doing now. Make a separate list of these things.\r\n\t\tStep six. Start doing the things on this list. Some of them will be daily tasks, such as spending less money on dining out and putting more money into your savings account. Others will be longer-range but will require daily progress, such as going the extra mile in your job. You have to bend all your efforts and thoughts to doing these things. Step seven. Every day read your goal aloud to yourself until you have it memorized.\r\n\tFlexible Habits\r\n\t\tBe sure to make your plan sufficiently flexible so that you can change it when you are so inspired. The key word here is “inspired.” As you put your plan into action and develop applied faith, Infinite Intelligence may hand you a better plan than the one you have made. Treat such inspiration respectfully, for it will help you strengthen your plan where it is weak.\r\n\t\tDon’t express contempt for your hunches. If you repeatedly say to yourself, “I had the most foolish idea today,” soon you will be having only foolish ideas. Instead write down your hunches as soon as they occur to you. Examine them carefully, and be sure you are not rejecting them simply because they involve something that hasn’t been done before or because they don’t conform to your current habits. The purpose of cosmic habitforce is to make  your habits serve you, not the other way around. Don’t let your habits become so ingrained that whatever useful purpose they once served, they now limit your opportunity, tolerance, faith, and enthusiasm.\r\n\tEfficient vs inefficient habits\r\n\t\tBeware of These Habits\r\n\t\t\tPoverty\r\n\t\t\tImaginary illness\r\n\t\t\tLaziness\r\n\t\t\tEnvy\r\n\t\t\tGreed\r\n\t\t\tVanity\r\n\t\t\tCynicism\r\n\t\t\tDrifting without aim or purpose\r\n\t\t\tIrritability\r\n\t\t\tRevenge\r\n\t\t\tJealousy\r\n\t\t\tDishonesty\r\n\t\t\tArrogance\r\n\t\t\tSadism\r\n\t\tEmbrace These Habits\r\n\t\t\tDefiniteness of purpose. This is the primary good habit. It makes you more alert, more imaginative, more enthusiastic, and it increases your willpower.\r\n\t\t\tFaith. Let your mind dwell on positive ideas and on clearing away all negative influences and fears. This takes self-discipline.\r\n\t\t\tPersonal initiative. You may have to force yourself at first to do things without being told to do them. But persistence will make it easier.\r\n\t\t\tEnthusiasm. Remember that controlled enthusiasm is your goal. You’ll want to be able to summon it at will or shut it off when it isn’t appropriate or might actually be dangerous.\r\n\t\t\tSelf-discipline. This is a circular process; the more you exercise it, the more you have it.\r\n\t\t\tGoing the extra mile. Start right now by doing something for which you don’t expect to do be paid directly. Go the extra mile every day by sheer effort if necessary, and soon the effort will be replaced by habit.\r\n\tControlling Your Willpower\r\n\t\t Developing positive habits which can be taken over by cosmic habitforce depends heavily on strong willpower. Here’s a review of the steps to strengthen your will:\r\n\t\t Step one. Actively ally yourself with other people who can help you attain your major purpose. A mastermind alliance creates multiple patterns for cosmic habitforce to work on.\r\n\t\tStep two. Develop your plan, drawing on all the members of your alliance for knowledge, ability, and the power of their faith.\r\n\t\tStep three. Distance yourself from anyone and any circumstance that make you feel inferior. A positive ego does not grow in a negative environment. Remember that cosmic habitforce cause every living thing to partake of the dominating influence of its environment.\r\n\t\tStep four. Close the door on the unpleasant experiences of the past. A strong will doesn’t dwell on the past; a vital ego thrives on hopes and desires of an as-yet-unattained objective. If you keep your mind in a state of hope and desire, cosmic habitforce goes to work changing your hopes and desires into their material equivalent.\r\n\t\tStep five. Surround yourself with every possible means of impressing your mind with the nature of your definite purpose. Hang mottoes on your walls; put up pictures of people doing what you want to do. You want to make it easier to create a mental image of yourself realizing your objective. The more you create this image, the sooner it will be taken over by cosmic habitforce and impressed on your subconscious.\r\n\t\tStep six. Watch out that you don’t overinflate your ego. One small prick with a pin and the escaping hot air will be like a runaway rocket, carrying you far away from where you want to be.\r\n\tThe Three Essentials of Cosmic Habitforce\r\n\t\tPlasticity - This is the capability to change. It also implies that once a change has been made, your new form will hold until a subsequent change is made; you won’t revert to your old status. Consider the difference between modeling clay, which is malleable but holds the shape it is given, and mercury, which can take any shape for a moment but will never keep it. You can be changed by environmental influences or by your own decisions.\r\n\t\tFrequency of Impression - Repetition is the mother of habit. One of the factors affecting the speed with which a habit can be adopted is how often it is consciously repeated. Your ability to do this may vary with circumstances. Your job may require enough concentration on the task at hand that you have to pay attention only to it and develop your habits is your spare  time. Personal initiative also comes into play; if you’re lazy, you won’t knock yourself out developing a habit. This can definitely slow down the process of acquiring it.\r\n\t\tIntensity of Impression - You can go through the motions of an activity, or you can concentrate on doing it; concentration builds the habit quickly. You impress the habit on your subconscious mind, and it become a part of everything you do.",

You’ll want to be able to summon it at will or shut it off when it isn’t appropriate or might actually be dangerous.\r\n\t\t\tSelf-discipline. This is a circular process; the more you exercise it, the more you have it.\r\n\t\t\tGoing the extra mile. Start right now by doing something for which you don’t expect to do be paid directly. Go the extra mile every day by sheer effort if necessary, and soon the effort will be replaced by habit.\r\n\tControlling Your Willpower\r\n\t\t Developing positive habits which can be taken over by cosmic habitforce depends heavily on strong willpower. Here’s a review of the steps to strengthen your will:\r\n\t\t Step one. Actively ally yourself with other people who can help you attain your major purpose. A mastermind alliance creates multiple patterns for cosmic habitforce to work on.\r\n\t\tStep two. Develop your plan, drawing on all the members of your alliance for knowledge, ability, and the power of their faith.\r\n\t\tStep three. Distance yourself from anyone and any circumstance that make you feel inferior. A positive ego does not grow in a negative environment. Remember that cosmic habitforce cause every living thing to partake of the dominating influence of its environment.\r\n\t\tStep four. Close the door on the unpleasant experiences of the past. A strong will doesn’t dwell on the past; a vital ego thrives on hopes and desires of an as-yet-unattained objective. If you keep your mind in a state of hope and desire, cosmic habitforce goes to work changing your hopes and desires into their material equivalent.\r\n\t\tStep five. Surround yourself with every possible means of impressing your mind with the nature of your definite purpose. Hang mottoes on your walls; put up pictures of people doing what you want to do. You want to make it easier to create a mental image of yourself realizing your objective. The more you create this image, the sooner it will be taken over by cosmic habitforce and impressed on your subconscious.\r\n\t\tStep six. Watch out that you don’t overinflate your ego. One small prick with a pin and the escaping hot air will be like a runaway rocket, carrying you far away from where you want to be.\r\n\tThe Three Essentials of Cosmic Habitforce\r\n\t\tPlasticity - This is the capability to change. It also implies that once a change has been made, your new form will hold until a subsequent change is made; you won’t revert to your old status. Consider the difference between modeling clay, which is malleable but holds the shape it is given, and mercury, which can take any shape for a moment but will never keep it. You can be changed by environmental influences or by your own decisions.\r\n\t\tFrequency of Impression - Repetition is the mother of habit. One of the factors affecting the speed with which a habit can be adopted is how often it is consciously repeated. Your ability to do this may vary with circumstances. Your job may require enough concentration on the task at hand that you have to pay attention only to it and develop your habits is your spare  time. Personal initiative also comes into play; if you’re lazy, you won’t knock yourself out developing a habit. This can definitely slow down the process of acquiring it.\r\n\t\tIntensity of Impression - You can go through the motions of an activity, or you can concentrate on doing it; concentration builds the habit quickly. You impress the habit on your subconscious mind, and it become a part of everything you do."

      "text": "DotCom Secrets \nRussell Brunson\r\n\tIntroduction\r\n\t\tLooking back, I think it’s funny that while most kids my age were collecting baseball cards, I was studying junk mail and learning marketing funnels.\r\n\t\tPeople who model the surface level of what others are doing and are frustrated that they aren’t getting similar results.\r\n\tFour important questions \r\n\t\tWho Is Your Dream Client? \r\n\t\t\tTo create hyper-targeted messages, you have to know your target market inside and out. Successful businesses get inside of the customer’s mind and find out what the individual really cares about. What are their pains and passions? What do they desire? What do they think about, and what do they search for online? When you can find out those tiny details, you can search more specifically and find buyers in not-so-obvious places.\r\n\t\tWhere Can You Find Them?\r\n\t\t\tOne of the coolest things about the Internet is the power of congregations. These seemingly unimportant groups of people gathering together in little corners of the Internet make it possible for people like you and me to get into business quickly and be successful without all the barriers and expensive hurdles of traditional media.\r\n\t\t\tRemember your target market is made up of real people, so you need to look at their real behavior. \n\nWhere do they hang out online? Where do they spend their time? What email newsletters might they subscribe to? What blogs do they read? What Facebook groups are they a part of? Are they even on Facebook—or do they prefer Instagram? What keywords are they searching for on Google? What books are they buying on Amazon? \n\nAnswering these questions can take some time and research, but it’s worth taking as much time as you need to develop a clear picture of where your ideal clients are directing their attention.\r\n\t\t\tThree types of Traffic\r\n\t\t\t\t1. Traffic you control\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou control traffic when you have the ability to tell it where to go. For example, if I purchase an ad on Google, I don’t own that traffic (Google does), but I can control it by buying an ad and then sending those who click on that ad anywhere I want. Any kind of paid traffic is traffic you control, including the following:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Email ads (solo ads, banners, links, mentions)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Pay-per-click ads (Facebook, Google, Yahoo, etc.)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Banner ads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Native ads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Affiliates and joint ventures\r\n\t\t\t\t2. Traffic you don’t control\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc.)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• Search traffic (search engine optimization or SEO)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• Guest blog traffic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• YouTube\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• Guest interviews\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNow, just like traffic that I control, my ONLY goal with traffic that I don’t control is also to turn it into traffic that I own.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Traffic you OWN\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTraffic you own is the BEST kind of traffic. It’s your email list or your followers, readers, customers, etc.\r\n\t\tWhat Bait Will You Use to Attract Them?\r\n\t\t\tYou are trying to engage someone who is already checking email, Facebook, and his cell phone at the exact same time. You have to interrupt potential customers long enough for them to click on your ad and visit your website.\r\n\t\t\tThe Attractive Character\r\n\t\t\t\tIt’s about the persona you’re sharing with your audience and how you communicate with your list. Most people either don’t bother to create this character, or they don’t do it correctly. So, I want to explain the process to you now. It’s one of the most important steps you can take when it comes to making sales. Once you intentionally create your AC, your business will change forever.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe four elements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Backstory. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou share your backstory because you want people to see where you came from. If they can relate to where you came from, then they will want to follow you to where you are now. If they don’t see the backstory, potential customers won’t follow you or listen to you. \nYou’ll seem untouchable; you won’t seem real to them. \n\nHowever, if they see that you were once in a similar situation, then they instantly identify with you and will follow you. Your story has provided a hook. You can then lay out the path, and they will want to follow that path.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Attractive Characters Speak in Parables.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA parable is a story about something that happened in your Attractive Character’s life. Most people let life pass them by, and they don’t stop to take note of the interesting things that happen to them. But you’re different. You have the ability to use the things that happen throughout your life to teach and inspire others—as well as sell products.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Attractive Characters Share Their Character Flaws.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo one wants to hear about the perfect person—because you can’t relate. Yet most of us try to put on a perfect facade for our audiences. Conversely, as soon as the audience knows you’re not perfect, that you have character flaws, then they will start to empathize with you. They’ll like you more because you are like them: not perfect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Attractive Characters Harness the Power of Polarity. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAttractive Characters are typically very polarizing. They share their opinions on hard matters, and they stick to their guns—no matter how many people disagree with them. \n\nThey draw a line in the sand. And when they take a stand for what they believe in, they split the audience into three camps: those who agree with them, those who are neutral, and those who will disagree with them. \n\nAs you start to create that polarization, it will change your “fair weather fans” into diehard fans who will follow what you say, share your message, and buy from you over and over again.\r\n\t\tWhat Result Do You Want To Give Them?\r\n\tFunnels\r\n\t\tValue Ladder\r\n\t\t\tThe deeper your funnel is, and the more things you can offer your clients, the more each customer will be worth to you. And the more they are worth to you, the more you can spend to acquire them. Remember this truth:\r\n\t\t\tBasic Value ladder\r\n\t\t\t\tBait\r\n\t\t\t\tFrontend\r\n\t\t\t\tMiddle\r\n\t\t\t\tBackend\r\n\t\tReverse Engineering a Successful Funnel\r\n\t\t\tBefore I start to build out any new sales funnel, the first thing I want to do is find other people who already have a successful funnel and are selling to my target market. \n\nIf I can’t find other businesses, then I won’t continue to move forward. But if I can find others who are already successfully selling to the chosen market, then I can reverse engineer what they’re doing and figure out where they are getting their traffic.\r\n\t\t\tHow\r\n\t\t\t\tStep #1: Where Are Your Competitors (Both Direct AND Indirect)? \r\n\t\t\t\t\tA direct competitor is a person or company selling something very similar to yours. In the supplement business, anyone else selling the same type of supplements is my direct competitor. We are trying to sell basically the same thing to the same people. We’re going to do a direct competitor analysis in a moment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are also indirect competitors. These are people or companies selling something different than you, but to the same demographic\r\n\t\t\t\tStep #2: What Are They Doing? \r\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarweb.com\r\n\t\t\t5 Variables of successful campaign\r\n\t\t\t\t1. Demographics\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe demographics are all the characteristics of the people you’re targeting. The demographics define who belongs in the target group and who doesn’t. We’re talking about distinguishing factors, like age, sex, education, geographical location, income level, race, language, and political affiliations—any and all characteristics you can think of that define those people you want to reach with your message.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. Offer\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe offer comes down to what you are selling and at what price point you are selling it, including your upsells and downsells.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Landing page\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the page a person lands on right after they click on an ad, and I believe it’s the most important page in your entire sales funnel. What does that page look like for your successful competitors? Is it an opt-in page? Is it a sales page? What’s working for people right now? \n\nI’m not going to make up my own landing page and hope it works. I’m going to reverse engineer what’s already working and model that for my own page. I’m going to make something very similar to what’s already successful.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Traffic source\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhere is your competitor’s traffic coming from? What are the specific websites that competitor buys ads on? Is the traffic coming from banner ads or social media or email? Does he use mainly video or text?\r\n\t\t\t\t5. Ad copy\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the last element of a successful campaign. What do successful ads look like? What makes people click on the ad? What’s enticing them to even look at the competitor’s ad in the first place? What pictures are competitors using? What does the headline say? What does the body copy look like? Are the competitors using video? All these things influence whether a person clicks on an ad or not. \r\n\t\t7 Phases of a Sales Funnel\r\n\t\t\tIt's all about the Pre-frame\r\n\t\t\t\tExperts in neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) talk a lot about pre-framing to gain the outcome you desire. A pre-frame is simply the state of mind you place someone in as they enter into the next step in your sales funnel. Changing the frame of mind, the mindset, can profoundly change the answer to a question or the experience you have with someone or something.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #1: Determine Traffic Temperature\r\n\t\t\t\tThe first phase to examine is the mindset of the traffic before it reaches your site—or, your traffic temperature. You may not ever think about it, but there are three levels of traffic that come to your website: hot, warm, and cold\r\n\t\t\t\tHot Traffic is made up of people who already know who you are. They’re on your email list, they subscribe to your podcast, they read your blog—you have an established relationship with them. You’re going to talk to these people like they’re your friends (because they are).\r\n\t\t\t\tWarm Traffic consists of people who don’t know you, but they have a relationship with somebody you know. This is where joint venture (JV) partnerships work well. Affiliates or JV partners have relationships with their lists, and they endorse you or your offer to their subscribers. They lend their credibility to you so their followers feel comfortable checking out your offers.\r\n\t\t\t\tCold Traffic is made up of people who have no idea who you are. They don’t know what you offer or whether they can trust you. These may be people you find on Facebook or who click on your pay-per-click ads. Maybe they stumble across your blog somehow. Most likely, you’re paying for this traffic somehow, so it’s important to pre-frame them correctly to get the highest return on your investment.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #2: Set Up the Pre-Frame Bridge\r\n\t\t\t\tA Hot Traffic Bridge is typically very short. You already have a relationship with these people, so you don’t have to do a lot of credibility building or pre-framing. You can probably just send out a quick email with a link to your landing page, and that’s about it.\r\n\t\t\t\tA Warm Traffic Bridge is a little longer than a hot traffic bridge, but not much. All that traffic needs is a little note of endorsement from a person they trust; then they’ll be in the right frame of mind to go to the landing page.\r\n\t\t\t\tA Cold Traffic Bridge. For cold traffic, you often need a whole separate page that they go through (the bridge page) before they hit the offer page. This separate, pre-frame page educates people, enabling them to better appreciate the offer and making them more likely to convert.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #3: Qualify Subscribers\r\n\t\t\t\tThe whole goal here is to take all the traffic—hot, warm, and cold— and find out who is willing to give us an email address in exchange for more information. (This is known as subscribing to a list.) \r\n\t\t\tPhase #4: Qualify Buyers\r\n\t\t\t\tImmediately after you qualify your subscribers, you want to find out who among them is a buyer. How many of those three hundred people who were interested in getting free information are willing to pull out their credit cards and make a purchase?\r\n\t\t\t\tAfter you’ve identified the buyers, you want to identify the hyperactive buyers. These are the people who are in some kind of pain right now and will buy more than one thing at a time.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #5: Identify Hyperactive Buyers\r\n\t\t\t\tAfter you’ve identified the buyers, you want to identify the hyperactive buyers. These are the people who are in some kind of pain right now and will buy more than one thing at a time.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #6: Age and Ascend the Relationship\r\n\t\t\t\tIf you’ve followed the five phases of the funnel up to here, you’ve already moved people through the first level or two (or three) on your Value Ladder. Now, you’re going to continue to provide value and help people with whatever you offer. \n\nAllow some time to pass. How much time is up to you; whatever feels logical for your product is best. Let them dig into whatever products they’ve already purchased, and give them enough time to see the value you give. You’re going to ascend them up the ladder over a longer period of time, eventually moving them to the very top level.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #7: Change the selling environment\r\n\t\t\t\tTypically, it’s difficult to sell super-expensive products or services online. Not many people are going to read a sales letter and click the buy button for a fifteen thousand dollar product. Some might, but usually you have to change the selling environment if you want to sell high-ticket products. The most common ways to change the environment are to sell the pricier items over the phone, through direct mail, or at a live event or seminar.",

      "originalText": "DotCom Secrets \nRussell Brunson\r\n\tIntroduction\r\n\t\tLooking back, I think it’s funny that while most kids my age were collecting baseball cards, I was studying junk mail and learning marketing funnels.\r\n\t\tPeople who model the surface level of what others are doing and are frustrated that they aren’t getting similar results.\r\n\tFour important questions \r\n\t\tWho Is Your Dream Client? \r\n\t\t\tTo create hyper-targeted messages, you have to know your target market inside and out. Successful businesses get inside of the customer’s mind and find out what the individual really cares about. What are their pains and passions? What do they desire? What do they think about, and what do they search for online? When you can find out those tiny details, you can search more specifically and find buyers in not-so-obvious places.\r\n\t\tWhere Can You Find Them?\r\n\t\t\tOne of the coolest things about the Internet is the power of congregations. These seemingly unimportant groups of people gathering together in little corners of the Internet make it possible for people like you and me to get into business quickly and be successful without all the barriers and expensive hurdles of traditional media.\r\n\t\t\tRemember your target market is made up of real people, so you need to look at their real behavior. \n\nWhere do they hang out online? Where do they spend their time? What email newsletters might they subscribe to? What blogs do they read? What Facebook groups are they a part of? Are they even on Facebook—or do they prefer Instagram? What keywords are they searching for on Google? What books are they buying on Amazon? \n\nAnswering these questions can take some time and research, but it’s worth taking as much time as you need to develop a clear picture of where your ideal clients are directing their attention.\r\n\t\t\tThree types of Traffic\r\n\t\t\t\t1. Traffic you control\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou control traffic when you have the ability to tell it where to go. For example, if I purchase an ad on Google, I don’t own that traffic (Google does), but I can control it by buying an ad and then sending those who click on that ad anywhere I want. Any kind of paid traffic is traffic you control, including the following:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Email ads (solo ads, banners, links, mentions)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Pay-per-click ads (Facebook, Google, Yahoo, etc.)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Banner ads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Native ads\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Affiliates and joint ventures\r\n\t\t\t\t2. Traffic you don’t control\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc.)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• Search traffic (search engine optimization or SEO)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• Guest blog traffic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• YouTube\r\n\t\t\t\t\t• Guest interviews\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNow, just like traffic that I control, my ONLY goal with traffic that I don’t control is also to turn it into traffic that I own.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Traffic you OWN\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTraffic you own is the BEST kind of traffic. It’s your email list or your followers, readers, customers, etc.\r\n\t\tWhat Bait Will You Use to Attract Them?\r\n\t\t\tYou are trying to engage someone who is already checking email, Facebook, and his cell phone at the exact same time. You have to interrupt potential customers long enough for them to click on your ad and visit your website.\r\n\t\t\tThe Attractive Character\r\n\t\t\t\tIt’s about the persona you’re sharing with your audience and how you communicate with your list. Most people either don’t bother to create this character, or they don’t do it correctly. So, I want to explain the process to you now. It’s one of the most important steps you can take when it comes to making sales. Once you intentionally create your AC, your business will change forever.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe four elements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Backstory. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou share your backstory because you want people to see where you came from. If they can relate to where you came from, then they will want to follow you to where you are now. If they don’t see the backstory, potential customers won’t follow you or listen to you. \nYou’ll seem untouchable; you won’t seem real to them. \n\nHowever, if they see that you were once in a similar situation, then they instantly identify with you and will follow you. Your story has provided a hook. You can then lay out the path, and they will want to follow that path.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Attractive Characters Speak in Parables.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA parable is a story about something that happened in your Attractive Character’s life. Most people let life pass them by, and they don’t stop to take note of the interesting things that happen to them. But you’re different. You have the ability to use the things that happen throughout your life to teach and inspire others—as well as sell products.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Attractive Characters Share Their Character Flaws.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo one wants to hear about the perfect person—because you can’t relate. Yet most of us try to put on a perfect facade for our audiences. Conversely, as soon as the audience knows you’re not perfect, that you have character flaws, then they will start to empathize with you. They’ll like you more because you are like them: not perfect.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Attractive Characters Harness the Power of Polarity. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAttractive Characters are typically very polarizing. They share their opinions on hard matters, and they stick to their guns—no matter how many people disagree with them. \n\nThey draw a line in the sand. And when they take a stand for what they believe in, they split the audience into three camps: those who agree with them, those who are neutral, and those who will disagree with them. \n\nAs you start to create that polarization, it will change your “fair weather fans” into diehard fans who will follow what you say, share your message, and buy from you over and over again.\r\n\t\tWhat Result Do You Want To Give Them?\r\n\tFunnels\r\n\t\tValue Ladder\r\n\t\t\tThe deeper your funnel is, and the more things you can offer your clients, the more each customer will be worth to you. And the more they are worth to you, the more you can spend to acquire them. Remember this truth:\r\n\t\t\tBasic Value ladder\r\n\t\t\t\tBait\r\n\t\t\t\tFrontend\r\n\t\t\t\tMiddle\r\n\t\t\t\tBackend\r\n\t\tReverse Engineering a Successful Funnel\r\n\t\t\tBefore I start to build out any new sales funnel, the first thing I want to do is find other people who already have a successful funnel and are selling to my target market. \n\nIf I can’t find other businesses, then I won’t continue to move forward. But if I can find others who are already successfully selling to the chosen market, then I can reverse engineer what they’re doing and figure out where they are getting their traffic.\r\n\t\t\tHow\r\n\t\t\t\tStep #1: Where Are Your Competitors (Both Direct AND Indirect)? \r\n\t\t\t\t\tA direct competitor is a person or company selling something very similar to yours. In the supplement business, anyone else selling the same type of supplements is my direct competitor. We are trying to sell basically the same thing to the same people. We’re going to do a direct competitor analysis in a moment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are also indirect competitors. These are people or companies selling something different than you, but to the same demographic\r\n\t\t\t\tStep #2: What Are They Doing? \r\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilarweb.com\r\n\t\t\t5 Variables of successful campaign\r\n\t\t\t\t1. Demographics\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe demographics are all the characteristics of the people you’re targeting. The demographics define who belongs in the target group and who doesn’t. We’re talking about distinguishing factors, like age, sex, education, geographical location, income level, race, language, and political affiliations—any and all characteristics you can think of that define those people you want to reach with your message.\r\n\t\t\t\t2. Offer\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe offer comes down to what you are selling and at what price point you are selling it, including your upsells and downsells.\r\n\t\t\t\t3. Landing page\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the page a person lands on right after they click on an ad, and I believe it’s the most important page in your entire sales funnel. What does that page look like for your successful competitors? Is it an opt-in page? Is it a sales page? What’s working for people right now? \n\nI’m not going to make up my own landing page and hope it works. I’m going to reverse engineer what’s already working and model that for my own page. I’m going to make something very similar to what’s already successful.\r\n\t\t\t\t4. Traffic source\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhere is your competitor’s traffic coming from? What are the specific websites that competitor buys ads on? Is the traffic coming from banner ads or social media or email? Does he use mainly video or text?\r\n\t\t\t\t5. Ad copy\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the last element of a successful campaign. What do successful ads look like? What makes people click on the ad? What’s enticing them to even look at the competitor’s ad in the first place? What pictures are competitors using? What does the headline say? What does the body copy look like? Are the competitors using video? All these things influence whether a person clicks on an ad or not. \r\n\t\t7 Phases of a Sales Funnel\r\n\t\t\tIt's all about the Pre-frame\r\n\t\t\t\tExperts in neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) talk a lot about pre-framing to gain the outcome you desire. A pre-frame is simply the state of mind you place someone in as they enter into the next step in your sales funnel. Changing the frame of mind, the mindset, can profoundly change the answer to a question or the experience you have with someone or something.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #1: Determine Traffic Temperature\r\n\t\t\t\tThe first phase to examine is the mindset of the traffic before it reaches your site—or, your traffic temperature. You may not ever think about it, but there are three levels of traffic that come to your website: hot, warm, and cold\r\n\t\t\t\tHot Traffic is made up of people who already know who you are. They’re on your email list, they subscribe to your podcast, they read your blog—you have an established relationship with them. You’re going to talk to these people like they’re your friends (because they are).\r\n\t\t\t\tWarm Traffic consists of people who don’t know you, but they have a relationship with somebody you know. This is where joint venture (JV) partnerships work well. Affiliates or JV partners have relationships with their lists, and they endorse you or your offer to their subscribers. They lend their credibility to you so their followers feel comfortable checking out your offers.\r\n\t\t\t\tCold Traffic is made up of people who have no idea who you are. They don’t know what you offer or whether they can trust you. These may be people you find on Facebook or who click on your pay-per-click ads. Maybe they stumble across your blog somehow. Most likely, you’re paying for this traffic somehow, so it’s important to pre-frame them correctly to get the highest return on your investment.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #2: Set Up the Pre-Frame Bridge\r\n\t\t\t\tA Hot Traffic Bridge is typically very short. You already have a relationship with these people, so you don’t have to do a lot of credibility building or pre-framing. You can probably just send out a quick email with a link to your landing page, and that’s about it.\r\n\t\t\t\tA Warm Traffic Bridge is a little longer than a hot traffic bridge, but not much. All that traffic needs is a little note of endorsement from a person they trust; then they’ll be in the right frame of mind to go to the landing page.\r\n\t\t\t\tA Cold Traffic Bridge. For cold traffic, you often need a whole separate page that they go through (the bridge page) before they hit the offer page. This separate, pre-frame page educates people, enabling them to better appreciate the offer and making them more likely to convert.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #3: Qualify Subscribers\r\n\t\t\t\tThe whole goal here is to take all the traffic—hot, warm, and cold— and find out who is willing to give us an email address in exchange for more information.

These are the people who are in some kind of pain right now and will buy more than one thing at a time.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #5: Identify Hyperactive Buyers\r\n\t\t\t\tAfter you’ve identified the buyers, you want to identify the hyperactive buyers. These are the people who are in some kind of pain right now and will buy more than one thing at a time.\r\n\t\t\tPhase #6: Age and Ascend the Relationship\r\n\t\t\t\tIf you’ve followed the five phases of the funnel up to here, you’ve already moved people through the first level or two (or three) on your Value Ladder.

      "text": "Evolving Your Concept of \"Self\"\nNeville Goddard\r\n\t1. Two important Questions\r\n\t\t1. Who are you?\r\n\t\t\tIt is impossible to do anything. You must be in order to do.\r\n\t\t\tEverything depends upon its attitude towards itself; that which it will not affirm as true of itself cannot awaken in its world. That is, your concept of yourself, such as \"I am strong,\" \"I am secure,\" \"I am loved,\" determines the world in which you live. In other words, when you say, \"I am a man, I am a father, I am an American,\" you are not defining different I AMs; you are defining different concepts or arrangements of the one cause-substance — the one I AM.\r\n\t\t\tConsciousness is one, manifesting in legions of forms or levels of consciousness. \n\nI may conceive myself to be a rich man, a poor man, a beggar man or a thief, but the center of my being remains the same regardless of the concept I hold of myself. \n\nAt the center of manifestation there is only one I AM manifesting in legions of forms or concepts of itself and \"I am that I am.\"\r\n\t\t2. Where are you going?\r\n\t\t\tIf you had a different concept of yourself, everything would be different. You are what you are, so everything is as it is. \n\nThe events which you observe are determined by the concept you have of yourself. If you change your concept of yourself, the events ahead of you in time are altered, but, thus altered, they form again a deterministic sequence starting from the moment of this changed concept.\r\n\t\t\tBy assuming the idea already to be a fact, it is converted into reality. Beyond that, free will ends and everything happens in harmony with the concept assumed.\r\n\t2. Conscious to Subconscious Competence\r\n\t\tThe question is often asked, \"What should be done between the assumption of the wish fulfilled and its realization?\" Nothing. It is a delusion that, other than assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you can do anything to aid the realization of your desire. \n\nYou think that you can do something, you want to do something; but actually you can do nothing. The illusion of the free will to do is but ignorance of the law of assumption upon which all action is based. Everything happens automatically.

      "originalText": "Evolving Your Concept of \"Self\"\nNeville Goddard\r\n\t1. Two important Questions\r\n\t\t1. Who are you?\r\n\t\t\tIt is impossible to do anything. You must be in order to do.\r\n\t\t\tEverything depends upon its attitude towards itself; that which it will not affirm as true of itself cannot awaken in its world. That is, your concept of yourself, such as \"I am strong,\" \"I am secure,\" \"I am loved,\" determines the world in which you live. In other words, when you say, \"I am a man, I am a father, I am an American,\" you are not defining different I AMs; you are defining different concepts or arrangements of the one cause-substance — the one I AM.\r\n\t\t\tConsciousness is one, manifesting in legions of forms or levels of consciousness. \n\nI may conceive myself to be a rich man, a poor man, a beggar man or a thief, but the center of my being remains the same regardless of the concept I hold of myself. \n\nAt the center of manifestation there is only one I AM manifesting in legions of forms or concepts of itself and \"I am that I am.\"\r\n\t\t2. Where are you going?\r\n\t\t\tIf you had a different concept of yourself, everything would be different. You are what you are, so everything is as it is. \n\nThe events which you observe are determined by the concept you have of yourself. If you change your concept of yourself, the events ahead of you in time are altered, but, thus altered, they form again a deterministic sequence starting from the moment of this changed concept.\r\n\t\t\tBy assuming the idea already to be a fact, it is converted into reality. Beyond that, free will ends and everything happens in harmony with the concept assumed.\r\n\t2. Conscious to Subconscious Competence\r\n\t\tThe question is often asked, \"What should be done between the assumption of the wish fulfilled and its realization?\" Nothing. It is a delusion that, other than assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you can do anything to aid the realization of your desire. \n\nYou think that you can do something, you want to do something; but actually you can do nothing. The illusion of the free will to do is but ignorance of the law of assumption upon which all action is based. Everything happens automatically. All that befalls you, all that is done by you — happens. \r\n\t\tYour assumptions, conscious or unconscious, direct all thought and action to their fulfillment. \n\nTo understand the law of assumption, to be convinced of its truth, means getting rid of all the illusions about free will to act. Free will actually means freedom to select any idea you desire. \r\n\t\tThe important thing to bear in mind is that you have infinite free will in choosing your assumptions, but no power to determine conditions and events. \n\nYou can create nothing, but your assumption determines what portion of creation you will experience.\r\n\t3. Experiential Based Assumptions\r\n\t\tThe power of attention is the measure of your inner force. Concentrated observation of one thing shuts out other things and causes them to disappear. \n\nThe ideas which impel you to action are those which dominate the consciousness, those which possess the attention\r\n\t\tHow are you saying \"I AM\" to?\r\n\t\t\tThe time it takes your assumption to become fact, your desire to be fulfilled, is directly proportionate to the naturalness of your feeling of already being what you want to be of already having what you desire.\r\n\t\t\tThis means to make your assumptions the highest, noblest, happiest concepts.

      "text": "Self-persuasion Externalized \n(Neville Goddard) \r\n\tWhat am I Assuming about SELF?\r\n\t\tI am trying to show you that the ancients told the same story in all the stories of the Bible. \n\nAll that they are trying to tell us is how to become that which we want to be. \n\nAnd they imply in every story that we do not need the assistance of another. \n\nYou do not need another to become now what you really want to be.\r\n\t\tThat assumption, subjectively appropriated and believed to be true, is faith. \r\n\t\t\tCan you believe in its reality? Knowing all things are possible to him who believes, can you persuade yourself that, although your reason and senses deny it, your assumption will make it so?\r\n\t\t\t Blake, in his wonderful \"Marriage of Heaven and Hell,\" said: \"I dined with Isaiah and Ezekiel and asked: Does a strong persuasion that a thing is so, make it so? and Isaiah replied: All prophets believe it does, and in ages of imagination a firm persuasion moved mountains, but many today are not capable of a firm persuasion of anything.\" \r\n\t\t\tEverything here was once only a desire, believed. This building, the clothes you wear or the car you drive were first a desire, then believed into being.\r\n\t\tIf you desire a change in your relationships at home or in business, you don't argue, you don't persuade them. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.\r\n\t\tNo matter what it is you desire, remember: nothing is impossible. What is now proved was once only imagined, so begin by imagining a state and persuading yourself that you are in it. Blake said: \"The ancients believed that if you are self-persuaded, it was so. There was a time in Imagination when a firm persuasion removed mountains.\" \r\n\t\tAssumptions about self in relation to others\r\n\t\t\tIn my thinking, speaking and acting, I realize that I Am unmoved by appearances yet, I move what appears.\r\n\t\t\tI realize that all others are myself and I have a greater ability each day to reflect upon how they represent the mood within me.\r\n\t\t\tMy desires from the divine are in harmony with all and do not know conflict with others\r\n\t\t\tDay by day, I release from self-imposed limitation of my imagination in relation to others by representing them from higher degrees of love.\r\n\t\t\tWhat I imagine in love for others is what I imagine in love for myself.\r\n\tLOVE it as TRUE (Natural Imagining)\r\n\t\tThe event must always imply fulfillment of the wish.

      "originalText": "Self-persuasion Externalized \n(Neville Goddard) \r\n\tWhat am I Assuming about SELF?\r\n\t\tI am trying to show you that the ancients told the same story in all the stories of the Bible. \n\nAll that they are trying to tell us is how to become that which we want to be. \n\nAnd they imply in every story that we do not need the assistance of another. \n\nYou do not need another to become now what you really want to be.\r\n\t\tThat assumption, subjectively appropriated and believed to be true, is faith. \r\n\t\t\tCan you believe in its reality? Knowing all things are possible to him who believes, can you persuade yourself that, although your reason and senses deny it, your assumption will make it so?\r\n\t\t\t Blake, in his wonderful \"Marriage of Heaven and Hell,\" said: \"I dined with Isaiah and Ezekiel and asked: Does a strong persuasion that a thing is so, make it so? and Isaiah replied: All prophets believe it does, and in ages of imagination a firm persuasion moved mountains, but many today are not capable of a firm persuasion of anything.\" \r\n\t\t\tEverything here was once only a desire, believed. This building, the clothes you wear or the car you drive were first a desire, then believed into being.\r\n\t\tIf you desire a change in your relationships at home or in business, you don't argue, you don't persuade them. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.\r\n\t\tNo matter what it is you desire, remember: nothing is impossible. What is now proved was once only imagined, so begin by imagining a state and persuading yourself that you are in it. Blake said: \"The ancients believed that if you are self-persuaded, it was so. There was a time in Imagination when a firm persuasion removed mountains.\" \r\n\t\tAssumptions about self in relation to others\r\n\t\t\tIn my thinking, speaking and acting, I realize that I Am unmoved by appearances yet, I move what appears.\r\n\t\t\tI realize that all others are myself and I have a greater ability each day to reflect upon how they represent the mood within me.\r\n\t\t\tMy desires from the divine are in harmony with all and do not know conflict with others\r\n\t\t\tDay by day, I release from self-imposed limitation of my imagination in relation to others by representing them from higher degrees of love.\r\n\t\t\tWhat I imagine in love for others is what I imagine in love for myself.\r\n\tLOVE it as TRUE (Natural Imagining)\r\n\t\tThe event must always imply fulfillment of the wish. Always construct an event which you believe you would naturally encounter following the fulfillment of your desire. You are the judge of what event you really want to realize.\r\n\t\t So can I persuade myself that you are as I desire to see you? Then, to the degree that I can persuade myself, you will conform in the outer world to that persuasion.\r\n\t\tYou can remove the seemingly mountainous obstacles which confront you by simply ignoring them and assuming the end. \n\nAnd if you have to go over the mountain, you will, or the mountain will be removed.

      "text": "Live In The End\nNeville Goddard\r\n\tThe creative word (Imagination)\r\n\t\tIn the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. (John 1:1) \n\nThe Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. )John 1:14)\r\n\t\tThat same creative Word that created the universe, and sustains it, dwells in us! Therefore, “with God all things are possible,” (Mark 10:27) and therefore with Man all things are possible. So, he states it in one book, Matthew, “With God all things are possible” but in Mark he states it, “All things are possible to him” – meaning man – “who believes.” Can man believe? \r\n\t\tSo, this Creative Word is in us. Well, what is this Creative Word? It’s your own wonderful human imagination! That’s Christ in man. Man is all imagination, and God is man, and exists in us, and we in Him. The eternal body of man is the imagination, and that is Christ Himself the divine body Jesus; and we are his members. \r\n\t\tSo, when you say, “I am,” that’s He. Now, can you believe that you are now the man that you would like to be, though at the moment of your assumption, reason denies it? And your senses deny it? Can you really conceive a scene – a scene, which if true, would imply the fulfillment of your dream? Just imagine it. Certainly you can imagine it, but the problem is: will you believe it? Will you believe in the reality of the thing imagined? \r\n\tStates of mind (Levels of consciousness)\r\n\t\tIf I could this very moment imagine myself into a state – any state at all – and dwell in it, well now, what is “dwelling in it”? Well, I’m dwelling in it. Well, that’s Christ! And that is the resurrecting power of the universe. So, if I remain in a state, I will resurrect it and objectify it in my world. But I have to select it and enter the state\r\n\t\tIf imagining creates reality, what are you imagining? For, if Christ is the only creative power in the universe, and I identify Him with my own imagination, well, then, my imagination is creating reality. So what am I imagining? \r\n\t\tPick up the morning’s paper, and I am fed with everything I should not feast upon – all the horrors of the world, all the negative states of the world; after having read it for an hour, then I must either regurgitate or in some strange way rub it out, because I can’t go through life feeding upon such nonsense.\r\n\tAll things are possible (Power of Christ)\r\n\t\tI daresay that everyone here would say, “Yes,” to the statement of Scripture, “With God, all things are possible.” (Mark 10:27)  \n\nI don’t think you’d be here if you did not believe in God, and the God to whom all things are possible. But maybe we stop right there, and we separate man from God, and my purpose is to show you that we are not two, that we are One – that God actually became man, that man may become God. \r\n\t\tWell, this is how I test myself: If Christ is in me, and all things are possible to Christ, then I must find out who he is. Well, I have found him as my own wonderful human imagination, and because he dwells – not only in me, he dwells in us – everything is possible to everyone in the world. \n\nAnd, so, you help man best by telling him who Christ is. You could give him all the things in the world that he needs, he’ll come back for more tomorrow unless he knows who Christ is.\r\n\t\tIs there anything in this world that wasn’t first imagined? Name one thing or point at one thing in this world for me that is now considered to be real that wasn’t first only imagined. \n\nWhat is now proved was once only imagined. Therefore, this is a true statement, “All things were made by Him.” (John 1:3) and He is your own wonderful human imagination. All objective reality is solely produced through imagining. The clothes you wear, the chairs on which you are seated, this in which we are now placed – everything was once only imagined.\r\n\tMyself pushed out (All is one mind individualized)\r\n\t\tChrist dwells in all, and Christ is the true identity of every man, then everyone must be myself “pushed out.” There can’t be another if God is one, therefore, I tell myself, as the seeming other, what I would do if I were you, and instead of giving him the thing that he needs physically, tell him how to get it for himself. \r\n\t\tI should actually know exactly what I would like to be, and, discovering what I would like to be against what I seem to be, dare to assume that I am it! And my assumption, though false, if persisted in, would harden into fact.\r\n\t\tSo, we are told in Scripture, “I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal,” (Deuteronomy 32:39) – I create the blessing; I create the curses, but, now, I must choose life. Choose the lovely things but don’t say there’s another creator, for if there is another creator then we are in conflict. \n\nSo, my own imagination can conjure unlovely things if I dwell upon them, or the lovely things, but there can’t be two gods. There can’t be two creators. And if I can find that Creator and identify Him with my own wonderful human imagination, then I can’t pass the buck. I can’t turn to anything and blame it for the things happening in my life.\r\n\tHow to live in the end\r\n\t\tWhat would you feel like if now you were the man that you want to be? How would you see the world if things were as you desire them to be? Now, this is what I mean by “living in the end.” \r\n\t\tWell, then, now – this very instant, you desire happiness in marriage. You say, “Well, there’s not one person in my world that is eligible. I know no one.” You don’t have to know anyone. \n\nAll you have to do is to decide within yourself what you want. Now, what would you do if it were true? Would you wear a ring on the one finger that would imply that some one placed it there? one that you admire? Well, then, wear it there. Don’t wear a physical ring. Put it on just as though he had placed it there, and sleep feeling that which you are feeling is real. \n\nDon’t say, “It’s all imagination.” Certainly it is, because all imagination is Christ, therefore, it’s all reality. So, when you say, “That’s only my imagination,” well, you are just saying, “That’s only a thing called Christ when you treat imagination that way.\r\n\t\tNow tonight, find out exactly what you – not what they think you ought to want – what you want. Ask no one’s permission. You don’t need any one’s permission; you only need your own decision. \n\nWhat do I want? Now, what would it be like if it were true? Now catch the mood, and try to give that mood all the sensory vividness of reality – all the tones of reality, and then sleep in it just as though it were true. And then await the inevitable. \r\n\t\tThe inevitable is that you are going to resurrect it and objectify it on the screen of space, and then the world will call it real, and they may not believe you. \n\nIt doesn’t really matter. If you tell them it came to pass because you simply imagined it – no, they will point to the series of events that led up to it, and they will give credit to the bridge of incidents, across which you walked towards the fulfillment of that state, and they will point out some physical thing that was the cause. \n\nNo, the cause is invisible, for the cause is God, and God is invisible to mortal eye.  \r\n\t\tWho knows what you are imagining? No one knows, but you can sit down and imagine, and no one can stop you from doing it, but can you give reality to the imagined state? \n\nIf you do, yes, a bridge of incidents will appear in your world, and you’ll walk across some series of events leading up to the fulfillment of the imaginal state. But don’t give causation to any physical step that you took towards the fulfillment of it. \r\n\t\tSo, when you know what you want, remain faithful to that assumption, and the assumption, though at the moment it is denied by your senses, and denied by reason – if you persist in it, it will harden into fact. \n\nAre we not told that God calls a thing that is not seen as though it were seen, and then the unseen becomes seen? (See Romans 4:17) He calls everything from the unseen into the seen in this simple manner, for He is the resurrecting power.",

      "originalText": "Live In The End\nNeville Goddard\r\n\tThe creative word (Imagination)\r\n\t\tIn the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. (John 1:1) \n\nThe Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. )John 1:14)\r\n\t\tThat same creative Word that created the universe, and sustains it, dwells in us! Therefore, “with God all things are possible,” (Mark 10:27) and therefore with Man all things are possible. So, he states it in one book, Matthew, “With God all things are possible” but in Mark he states it, “All things are possible to him” – meaning man – “who believes.” Can man believe? \r\n\t\tSo, this Creative Word is in us. Well, what is this Creative Word? It’s your own wonderful human imagination! That’s Christ in man. Man is all imagination, and God is man, and exists in us, and we in Him. The eternal body of man is the imagination, and that is Christ Himself the divine body Jesus; and we are his members. \r\n\t\tSo, when you say, “I am,” that’s He. Now, can you believe that you are now the man that you would like to be, though at the moment of your assumption, reason denies it? And your senses deny it? Can you really conceive a scene – a scene, which if true, would imply the fulfillment of your dream? Just imagine it. Certainly you can imagine it, but the problem is: will you believe it? Will you believe in the reality of the thing imagined? \r\n\tStates of mind (Levels of consciousness)\r\n\t\tIf I could this very moment imagine myself into a state – any state at all – and dwell in it, well now, what is “dwelling in it”? Well, I’m dwelling in it. Well, that’s Christ! And that is the resurrecting power of the universe. So, if I remain in a state, I will resurrect it and objectify it in my world. But I have to select it and enter the state\r\n\t\tIf imagining creates reality, what are you imagining? For, if Christ is the only creative power in the universe, and I identify Him with my own imagination, well, then, my imagination is creating reality. So what am I imagining? \r\n\t\tPick up the morning’s paper, and I am fed with everything I should not feast upon – all the horrors of the world, all the negative states of the world; after having read it for an hour, then I must either regurgitate or in some strange way rub it out, because I can’t go through life feeding upon such nonsense.\r\n\tAll things are possible (Power of Christ)\r\n\t\tI daresay that everyone here would say, “Yes,” to the statement of Scripture, “With God, all things are possible.” (Mark 10:27)  \n\nI don’t think you’d be here if you did not believe in God, and the God to whom all things are possible. But maybe we stop right there, and we separate man from God, and my purpose is to show you that we are not two, that we are One – that God actually became man, that man may become God. \r\n\t\tWell, this is how I test myself: If Christ is in me, and all things are possible to Christ, then I must find out who he is. Well, I have found him as my own wonderful human imagination, and because he dwells – not only in me, he dwells in us – everything is possible to everyone in the world. \n\nAnd, so, you help man best by telling him who Christ is. You could give him all the things in the world that he needs, he’ll come back for more tomorrow unless he knows who Christ is.\r\n\t\tIs there anything in this world that wasn’t first imagined? Name one thing or point at one thing in this world for me that is now considered to be real that wasn’t first only imagined. \n\nWhat is now proved was once only imagined. Therefore, this is a true statement, “All things were made by Him.” (John 1:3) and He is your own wonderful human imagination. All objective reality is solely produced through imagining. The clothes you wear, the chairs on which you are seated, this in which we are now placed – everything was once only imagined.\r\n\tMyself pushed out (All is one mind individualized)\r\n\t\tChrist dwells in all, and Christ is the true identity of every man, then everyone must be myself “pushed out.” There can’t be another if God is one, therefore, I tell myself, as the seeming other, what I would do if I were you, and instead of giving him the thing that he needs physically, tell him how to get it for himself. \r\n\t\tI should actually know exactly what I would like to be, and, discovering what I would like to be against what I seem to be, dare to assume that I am it! And my assumption, though false, if persisted in, would harden into fact.\r\n\t\tSo, we are told in Scripture, “I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal,” (Deuteronomy 32:39) – I create the blessing; I create the curses, but, now, I must choose life. Choose the lovely things but don’t say there’s another creator, for if there is another creator then we are in conflict. \n\nSo, my own imagination can conjure unlovely things if I dwell upon them, or the lovely things, but there can’t be two gods. There can’t be two creators. And if I can find that Creator and identify Him with my own wonderful human imagination, then I can’t pass the buck. I can’t turn to anything and blame it for the things happening in my life.\r\n\tHow to live in the end\r\n\t\tWhat would you feel like if now you were the man that you want to be? How would you see the world if things were as you desire them to be? Now, this is what I mean by “living in the end.” \r\n\t\tWell, then, now – this very instant, you desire happiness in marriage. You say, “Well, there’s not one person in my world that is eligible. I know no one.” You don’t have to know anyone. \n\nAll you have to do is to decide within yourself what you want. Now, what would you do if it were true? Would you wear a ring on the one finger that would imply that some one placed it there? one that you admire? Well, then, wear it there. Don’t wear a physical ring. Put it on just as though he had placed it there, and sleep feeling that which you are feeling is real. \n\nDon’t say, “It’s all imagination.” Certainly it is, because all imagination is Christ, therefore, it’s all reality. So, when you say, “That’s only my imagination,” well, you are just saying, “That’s only a thing called Christ when you treat imagination that way.\r\n\t\tNow tonight, find out exactly what you – not what they think you ought to want – what you want. Ask no one’s permission. You don’t need any one’s permission; you only need your own decision. \n\nWhat do I want? Now, what would it be like if it were true? Now catch the mood, and try to give that mood all the sensory vividness of reality – all the tones of reality, and then sleep in it just as though it were true. And then await the inevitable. \r\n\t\tThe inevitable is that you are going to resurrect it and objectify it on the screen of space, and then the world will call it real, and they may not believe you. \n\nIt doesn’t really matter. If you tell them it came to pass because you simply imagined it – no, they will point to the series of events that led up to it, and they will give credit to the bridge of incidents, across which you walked towards the fulfillment of that state, and they will point out some physical thing that was the cause. \n\nNo, the cause is invisible, for the cause is God, and God is invisible to mortal eye.  \r\n\t\tWho knows what you are imagining?

But don’t give causation to any physical step that you took towards the fulfillment of it. \r\n\t\tSo, when you know what you want, remain faithful to that assumption, and the assumption, though at the moment it is denied by your senses, and denied by reason – if you persist in it, it will harden into fact. \n\nAre we not told that God calls a thing that is not seen as though it were seen, and then the unseen becomes seen? (See Romans 4:17) He calls everything from the unseen into the seen in this simple manner, for He is the resurrecting power."

      "text": "Reality Transurfing\nVadim Zeland\r\n\tThe meaning of this word can be interpreted as “surfing through the space of variations” or “transforming potential options into reality” or “sliding through life lines.” But basically, if you use the method Transurfing, then you ride on a wave of success.\r\n\tChapter 1 - The Space of Variations\r\n\t\tIt is an information structure — infinite data field containing all versions of all events that could happen. You could say that it contains everything that was, is and will be. Space of variations is a template, grid of motion of matter in space and time. Both past and future are there stationary, like frames from a movie roll-film and the time happens only during the movement of an individual frame, in which the present is contained.\r\n\t\tIntention\r\n\t\t\tThe intention is divided into external and internal one. Internal one is related to actively influencing the outside world — a determination to act. The external intention is a determination to have, when the world becomes subject to human will. Internal intention focuses on the process of our own movement towards the goal, external — focuses attention on how the goal gets realized by itself.\n\nGoal is achieved using internal intention, while it is selected using the external one.\r\n\t\tChoice\r\n\t\t\tTransurfing offers fundamentally different approach to achieving objectives. One makes a choice, as if ordering in a restaurant, without worrying about the means to achieve it. In most cases the goal gets realized by itself, regardless of the direct actions of the client. Your desires are not fulfilled. Your dreams will not come true. But your choice is an irrevocable law and it will inevitably happen. It is impossible to explain in a nutshell the essence of choice. All the Transurfing deals with what is choice and how to make it.\r\n\t\tLife Track\r\n\t\t\tA human life, just like other matter, is essentially a chain of cause and effect. An effect in the space of variants is always situated close to its cause. In the same way, one follows the other, the near lying sectors in the space of variants assemble into a life track. Scenarios and decorations of the sectors found on the same life line are more or less uniform in their quality. The human life moves evenly along its track until there is an event that introduces a substantial change in the scenario and decorations.\r\n\t\tThe space of variations is an information field of what was, what is, and what will be.\r\n\t\tReality can be manifested in an infinite number of ways.\r\n\t\tAny branch of knowledge is based on a chosen aspect of the manifested reality.\r\n\t\tYour choice is always made into reality. What you choose is what you get.\r\n\t\tEach organism makes its own contribution to the formation of material realizations.\r\n\t\tDon’t fight for happiness – you can simply choose a variation that you like.\r\n\tChapter 2 - Pendulums\r\n\t\tGroups of people thinking in the same direction create information based energy structures called pendulums. These structures will eventually begin to develop independently. Pendulums create their own laws and make people obey them. What people don’t realize is that they are unwillingly acting in the interests of these pendulums\r\n\t\tA pendulum is created by the energy of people who are thinking in the same direction.\r\n\t\tA pendulum is an energy-based information structure.\r\n\t\tDistinctions\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum feeds on the energy of its adherents and thereby amplifies its swinging.\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum tries to attract as many supporters as possible, so that it can receive as much energy as possible.\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum sets its group of adherents against all other groups (Look at us! We are better than they are).\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum is aggressive in blaming all those that don’t want to become Its adherents, and it tries to win them over, neutralize them or remove them all together.\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum puts on good-looking and attractive masks, it covers itself up with noble aims and plays on people’s emotions, in order to justify its own actions and win over as many adherents as possible.\r\n\t\tA destructive pendulum forces goals onto its adherents that are alien to them.\r\n\t\tA pendulum plays on people’s feelings, attracting them into its net.\r\n\t\tPositive visualization will gently extinguish a pendulum.\r\n\t\tIn order to solve problems – rent yourself out.\r\n\tChapter 3 - The Wave of Success\r\n\t\tThe wave of fortune is formed as an assemblage of life lines that are favorable to you. The space of variants contains all things, including these gold veins. When you find yourself on such line and get lucky, you can glide, under inertia onto the other lines of the assemblage, where new fortunate circumstances will follow.\r\n\t\tBut if after the first success you once again strike a bad patch, then you have been hooked by a destructive pendulum (extractor), which has taken you away from the wave of fortune.\r\n\t\tIn order for your love to be reciprocated, it’s necessary to abandon the right of possession.\r\n\t\tFree yourself from the need to confirm your superiority.\r\n\t\tStriving to hide one’s flaws creates the opposite effect.\r\n\t\tThe higher the importance of the goal, the less likely it is that you will reach it.\r\n\t\tSay no to any feeling of guilt and to the need to justify yourself.\r\n\t\tIn order refuse the feeling of guilt, it is enough to allow yourself to be you.\r\n\t\tNo one has the right to judge you. You have the right to be yourself.\r\n\t\tImportance is the only obstacle on the path to fulfilling your desire.\r\n\t\tDo not overcome obstacles – reduce their importance.\r\n\t\tCare without worrying.\r\n\t\tSigns\r\n\t\t\tGuiding signs appear only in the event that a transition to another life-line begins. You probably will not notice the different phenomena. For example, a crow caws over you, and you do not pay attention. You didn’t feel a qualitative difference, meaning that you are still staying on the previous line. But if something makes you become alert, this is a sign. Its distinguishing feature is that always indicates the beginning of a transition on a substantially different life line.\r\n\t\tPolarization\r\n\t\t\tExcessive potentials arise when giving undue importance to some properties. A relationship of dependency is created when people begin to compare each other, to confront and to set conditions like “if you do so, I will do so-and-so.” \n\nExcessive potential is not scary, while the distorted assessment exists by itself.

      "originalText": "Reality Transurfing\nVadim Zeland\r\n\tThe meaning of this word can be interpreted as “surfing through the space of variations” or “transforming potential options into reality” or “sliding through life lines.” But basically, if you use the method Transurfing, then you ride on a wave of success.\r\n\tChapter 1 - The Space of Variations\r\n\t\tIt is an information structure — infinite data field containing all versions of all events that could happen. You could say that it contains everything that was, is and will be. Space of variations is a template, grid of motion of matter in space and time. Both past and future are there stationary, like frames from a movie roll-film and the time happens only during the movement of an individual frame, in which the present is contained.\r\n\t\tIntention\r\n\t\t\tThe intention is divided into external and internal one. Internal one is related to actively influencing the outside world — a determination to act. The external intention is a determination to have, when the world becomes subject to human will. Internal intention focuses on the process of our own movement towards the goal, external — focuses attention on how the goal gets realized by itself.\n\nGoal is achieved using internal intention, while it is selected using the external one.\r\n\t\tChoice\r\n\t\t\tTransurfing offers fundamentally different approach to achieving objectives. One makes a choice, as if ordering in a restaurant, without worrying about the means to achieve it. In most cases the goal gets realized by itself, regardless of the direct actions of the client. Your desires are not fulfilled. Your dreams will not come true. But your choice is an irrevocable law and it will inevitably happen. It is impossible to explain in a nutshell the essence of choice. All the Transurfing deals with what is choice and how to make it.\r\n\t\tLife Track\r\n\t\t\tA human life, just like other matter, is essentially a chain of cause and effect. An effect in the space of variants is always situated close to its cause. In the same way, one follows the other, the near lying sectors in the space of variants assemble into a life track. Scenarios and decorations of the sectors found on the same life line are more or less uniform in their quality. The human life moves evenly along its track until there is an event that introduces a substantial change in the scenario and decorations.\r\n\t\tThe space of variations is an information field of what was, what is, and what will be.\r\n\t\tReality can be manifested in an infinite number of ways.\r\n\t\tAny branch of knowledge is based on a chosen aspect of the manifested reality.\r\n\t\tYour choice is always made into reality. What you choose is what you get.\r\n\t\tEach organism makes its own contribution to the formation of material realizations.\r\n\t\tDon’t fight for happiness – you can simply choose a variation that you like.\r\n\tChapter 2 - Pendulums\r\n\t\tGroups of people thinking in the same direction create information based energy structures called pendulums. These structures will eventually begin to develop independently. Pendulums create their own laws and make people obey them. What people don’t realize is that they are unwillingly acting in the interests of these pendulums\r\n\t\tA pendulum is created by the energy of people who are thinking in the same direction.\r\n\t\tA pendulum is an energy-based information structure.\r\n\t\tDistinctions\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum feeds on the energy of its adherents and thereby amplifies its swinging.\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum tries to attract as many supporters as possible, so that it can receive as much energy as possible.\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum sets its group of adherents against all other groups (Look at us! We are better than they are).\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum is aggressive in blaming all those that don’t want to become Its adherents, and it tries to win them over, neutralize them or remove them all together.\r\n\t\t\tA pendulum puts on good-looking and attractive masks, it covers itself up with noble aims and plays on people’s emotions, in order to justify its own actions and win over as many adherents as possible.\r\n\t\tA destructive pendulum forces goals onto its adherents that are alien to them.\r\n\t\tA pendulum plays on people’s feelings, attracting them into its net.\r\n\t\tPositive visualization will gently extinguish a pendulum.\r\n\t\tIn order to solve problems – rent yourself out.\r\n\tChapter 3 - The Wave of Success\r\n\t\tThe wave of fortune is formed as an assemblage of life lines that are favorable to you. The space of variants contains all things, including these gold veins. When you find yourself on such line and get lucky, you can glide, under inertia onto the other lines of the assemblage, where new fortunate circumstances will follow.\r\n\t\tBut if after the first success you once again strike a bad patch, then you have been hooked by a destructive pendulum (extractor), which has taken you away from the wave of fortune.\r\n\t\tIn order for your love to be reciprocated, it’s necessary to abandon the right of possession.\r\n\t\tFree yourself from the need to confirm your superiority.\r\n\t\tStriving to hide one’s flaws creates the opposite effect.\r\n\t\tThe higher the importance of the goal, the less likely it is that you will reach it.\r\n\t\tSay no to any feeling of guilt and to the need to justify yourself.\r\n\t\tIn order refuse the feeling of guilt, it is enough to allow yourself to be you.\r\n\t\tNo one has the right to judge you. You have the right to be yourself.\r\n\t\tImportance is the only obstacle on the path to fulfilling your desire.\r\n\t\tDo not overcome obstacles – reduce their importance.\r\n\t\tCare without worrying.\r\n\t\tSigns\r\n\t\t\tGuiding signs appear only in the event that a transition to another life-line begins. You probably will not notice the different phenomena. For example, a crow caws over you, and you do not pay attention. You didn’t feel a qualitative difference, meaning that you are still staying on the previous line. But if something makes you become alert, this is a sign. Its distinguishing feature is that always indicates the beginning of a transition on a substantially different life line.\r\n\t\tPolarization\r\n\t\t\tExcessive potentials arise when giving undue importance to some properties. A relationship of dependency is created when people begin to compare each other, to confront and to set conditions like “if you do so, I will do so-and-so.” \n\nExcessive potential is not scary, while the distorted assessment exists by itself. But if the artificially high assessment of one object is compared to another, polarization occurs, and it in turn gives rise to the wind of the balancing forces. They try to eliminate the occurred polarization and in most cases their action is directed against the one who created it.\r\n\t\tBalancing Forces\r\n\t\t\tWherever there is excessive potential, Balancing Forces arise, directed towards its removal. They are created by mental energy when a person gives undue importance to an object.\r\n\tChapter 4 - An Induced Transition\r\n\t\tEach man creates a separate layer of the world, where he lives.\r\n\t\tThe world of people as a whole consists of individual layers, placed on top of each other.\r\n\t\tA response to a negative event induces the transfer to negative life tracks.\r\n\t\t“Don’t allow” means not to avoid, but to intentionally ignore and not become interested in certain kinds of information.\r\n\tChapter 5 - The Flow of Variations\r\n\t\tThe soul doesn’t think and doesn’t speak, but it feels and knows.\r\n\t\tIf you have the possibility to refuse an uncomfortable decision – refuse it.\r\n\t\tThe mind strives to control, not its own movement along the flow, but the flow itself.\r\n\t\tHaving relinquished control, you will get real control over a situation.\r\n\t\tIf you move along the flow of variations, the world will come out to greet you."

If you think and dwell upon fears, troubles, and failure, you will be guided in the wrong direction, and more chaos and confusion will be experienced by you.\r\n\t\tTake this great thought, and dwell upon it: There is nothing to fear in all of the universe! You have the power of control through the wise use of your subconscious mind. Sit down quietly now, and think of a beautiful lake on top of a mountain; it is a still, quiet night. \n\nOn the surface of the quiet, placid lake you see mirrored the stars, the moon, and perhaps the trees nearby. If the lake is disturbed, you will not see the stars or the moon. Similarly quiet your mind, relax, and let go. Think of peace and stillness; then over the mirrored waters of your mind will move the answer to your question!\r\n\tOvercoming Fear Through the Subconscious mind\r\n\t\tFollowing is a process and technique for overcoming fear which I teach from the platform — it works like a charm. Try it! Suppose you are afraid of the water, or a mountain, an interview, an audition, or you fear closed places. If afraid of swimming, begin now to sit still for five or ten minutes, for three or four times a day, and imagine you are swimming. Actually you are swimming in your mind; it is a subjective experience. \n\nMentally you have projected yourself into the water. You feel the chill of the water and the movement of your arms and legs. It is all real, vivid, and a joyous activity of the mind. It is not idle day dreaming, for you know what you are subjectively experiencing in your imagination will be developed in your subconscious mind; then you will be compelled to express the image and likeness of the picture you\nimpressed on your deeper mind; this is the law of the subconscious.\n\nAs you continue to discipline your mind this way, you are mentally immersed in the water and happy in it, consequently the fear passes; you will enter the water physically. I might say you will be compelled to give a good performance. You have consciously called upon the wonderful power of your subconscious which is all wise and powerful; this power controls you and governs you ac- cording to the nature of your call or request. This is a wonderful thing to know and a marvelous thing to do.",

If you think and dwell upon fears, troubles, and failure, you will be guided in the wrong direction, and more chaos and confusion will be experienced by you.\r\n\t\tTake this great thought, and dwell upon it: There is nothing to fear in all of the universe! You have the power of control through the wise use of your subconscious mind. Sit down quietly now, and think of a beautiful lake on top of a mountain; it is a still, quiet night. \n\nOn the surface of the quiet, placid lake you see mirrored the stars, the moon, and perhaps the trees nearby. If the lake is disturbed, you will not see the stars or the moon. Similarly quiet your mind, relax, and let go. Think of peace and stillness; then over the mirrored waters of your mind will move the answer to your question!\r\n\tOvercoming Fear Through the Subconscious mind\r\n\t\tFollowing is a process and technique for overcoming fear which I teach from the platform — it works like a charm. Try it! Suppose you are afraid of the water, or a mountain, an interview, an audition, or you fear closed places. If afraid of swimming, begin now to sit still for five or ten minutes, for three or four times a day, and imagine you are swimming. Actually you are swimming in your mind; it is a subjective experience. \n\nMentally you have projected yourself into the water. You feel the chill of the water and the movement of your arms and legs. It is all real, vivid, and a joyous activity of the mind. It is not idle day dreaming, for you know what you are subjectively experiencing in your imagination will be developed in your subconscious mind; then you will be compelled to express the image and likeness of the picture you\nimpressed on your deeper mind; this is the law of the subconscious.\n\nAs you continue to discipline your mind this way, you are mentally immersed in the water and happy in it, consequently the fear passes; you will enter the water physically. I might say you will be compelled to give a good performance. You have consciously called upon the wonderful power of your subconscious which is all wise and powerful; this power controls you and governs you ac- cording to the nature of your call or request. This is a wonderful thing to know and a marvelous thing to do."

It is the mystic ladder which reaches from earth to heaven, from error to Truth, from pain to peace. Every saint has climbed it; every sinner must sooner or later come to it, and every weary pilgrim that turns his back upon self and the world, and sets his face resolutely toward the Father's Home, must plant his feet upon its golden rounds. Without its aid you cannot grow into the divine state, the divine likeness, the divine peace, and the fadeless glories and unpolluting joys of Truth will remain hidden from you.\r\n\t\tMeditation is the intense dwelling, in thought, upon an idea or theme, with the object of thoroughly comprehending it, and whatsoever you constantly meditate upon you will not only come to understand, but will grow more and more into its likeness, for it will become incorporated into your very being, will become, in fact, your very self.\r\n\t\tHe who would secure any worldly advantage must be willing to work vigorously for it, and he would be foolish indeed who, waiting with folded hands, expected it to come to him for the mere asking. Do not then vainly imagine that you can obtain the heavenly possessions without making an effort. \n\nOnly when you commence to work earnestly in the Kingdom of Truth will you be allowed to partake of the Bread of Life, and when you have, by patient and uncomplaining effort, earned the spiritual wages for which you ask, they will not be withheld from you.\r\n\tThe Two Masters, Self and Truth\r\n\t\tUpon the battlefield of the human soul two masters are ever contending for the crown of supremacy, for the kingship and dominion of the heart; the master of self, called also the \"Prince of this world,\" and the master of Truth, called also the Father God. The master self is that rebellious one whose weapons are passion, pride, avarice, vanity, self-will, implements of darkness; the master Truth is that meek and lowly one whose weapons are gentleness, patience, purity, sacrifice, humility, love, instruments of Light.\r\n\t\tThere is one quality which pre-eminently distinguishes the man of Truth from the man of self, and that is humility. To be not only free from vanity, stubbornness and egotism, but to regard one's own opinions as of no value, this indeed is true humility.\r\n\tThe Acquirement of Spiritual Power\r\n\t\tMen and women of real power and influence are few, because few are prepared to make the sacrifice necessary to the acquirement of power, and fewer still are ready to patiently build up character.\r\n\t\tTo be swayed by your fluctuating thoughts and impulses is to be weak and powerless; to rightly control and direct those forces is to be strong and powerful.\r\n\t\tThe man that stands upon a principle is the same calm, dauntless, self-possessed man under all circumstances. When the hour of trial comes, and he has to decide between his personal comforts and Truth, he gives up his comforts and remains firm.\r\n\tThe Realization of Selfless Love\r\n\t\tIt is said that Michaelangelo saw in every rough block of stone a thing of beauty awaiting the master-hand to bring it into reality. Even so, within each there reposes the Divine Image awaiting the master-hand of Faith and the chisel of Patience to bring it into manifestation. And that Divine Image is revealed and realized as stainless, selfless Love.\r\n\t\tTo reach this Love, to understand and experience it, one must work with great persistency and diligence upon his heart and mind, must ever renew his patience and keep strong his faith, for there will be much to remove, much to accomplish before the Divine Image is revealed in all its glorious beauty.\r\n\tEntering into The Infinite\r\n\t\tTo re-become one with the Infinite is the goal of man. To enter into perfect harmony with the Eternal Law is Wisdom, Love and Peace. But this divine state is, and must ever be, incomprehensible to the merely personal. \n\nPersonality, separateness, selfishness are one and the same, and are the antithesis of wisdom and divinity. By the unqualified surrender of the personality, separateness and selfishness cease, and man enters into the possession of his divine heritage of immortality and infinity.\r\n\tSaints, Sages and Saviors; The Law of Service\r\n\t\tThe measure of a man's truth is the measure of his love, and Truth is far removed from him whose life is not governed by Love.\r\n\t\tHe who is patient, calm, gentle, and forgiving under all circumstances, manifests the Truth. Truth will never be proved by wordy arguments and learned treatises, for if men do not perceive the Truth in infinite patience, undying forgiveness, and all-embracing compassion, no words can ever prove it to them.\r\n\t\tIt is given to the world to learn one great and divine lesson, the lesson of absolute unselfishness. The saints, sages, and saviors of all time are they who have submitted themselves to this task, and have learned and lived it. All the Scriptures of the world are framed to teach this one lesson; all the great teachers reiterate it. It is too simple for the world which, scorning it, stumbles along in the complex ways of selfishness.\r\n\t\t\tIn all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order. \r\n\tThe Realization of Perfect Peace\r\n\t\tCome away, for awhile, from external things, from the pleasures of the senses, from the arguments of the intellect, from the noise and the excitements of the world, and withdraw yourself into the inmost chamber of your heart, and there, free from the sacrilegious intrusion of all selfish desires, you will find a deep silence, a holy calm, a blissful repose, and if you will rest awhile in that holy place, and will meditate there, the faultless eye of Truth will open within you, and you will see things as they really are.\r\n\t\tThis holy place within you is your real and eternal self; it is the divine within you; and only when you identify yourself with it can you be said to be \"clothed and in your right mind.\" It is the abode of peace, the temple of wisdom, the dwelling-place of immortality.

You can secure customer relationships by:\r\n\t\t\tKeeping in touch -- whether it be by telephone. mail, or in person --\nall customers want to feel that they are special and that you take\nspecial interest in seeing to their needs.\r\n\t\t\tProviding post-purchase reassurance. Each time a customer places an order with you, call him/her a week after receiving your product or service to see how it's going. This will allay any post-purchase dissonance\r\n\t\t\t\tBenefits of Post-Purchase Reassurance\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou allay any 'post-purchase dissonance' (buyer's remorse) that may\nbe festering in the mind of your customer, his/her family or\nassociates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou dramatically reduce -- and perhaps eliminate -- the refunds.\nexchanges or costly service expenses that disenchantment always\nproduces.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou make the customer more receptive to your next offer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou develop a closer relationship with your customers and satisfy their cravings to be acknowledged.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou give yourself an opportunity to recommend a buying strategy that includes continuous repurchasing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou get the chance to immediately 'upsell' the customer to some more expensive product or service that you make available exclusively to them at a preferential price.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can solicit a customer's sales referral.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can often tum the initial sale into a renewable annual contract by adding more products or services at a discount.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can explain the use of the product so It will be used more often and reordered sooner.\"\r\n\t\t\tGiving your clients the best deals and guarantees that you possibly can get away with.\r\n\t\t\tPreferential pricing -- let your 'old' customers In on the best deals first. Give them the opportunity to buy your sale items before the public does.\r\n\t\t\tBuilding rapport and trust. Be as honest as you can be with your customers. People do business with ethical people they can trust.\r\n\t\t3 ways to grow \nyour business\r\n\t\t\t1. Increase your number of \nbuyers/clients/prospects\r\n\t\t\t\tlead generation + converting more\r\n\t\t\t\tBy making it inviting, easy, informative, nonthreatening. educational. inspiring, and fun\nto do business with you, you'll lift your company above your competition.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. You cannot service too much.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. You cannot educate enough.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. You cannot inform too much.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. You cannot offer too much follow up or follow through too far.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5. You cannot make ordering too easy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6. You cannot make calling or coming into your business too desirable.\r\n\t\t\t\tMethods\r\n\t\t\t\t\tConverting Prospects\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe more synergy you can bring together In your package, the better.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy reducing the cost to a modest and nonthreatening monthly or quarterly payment, you dramatically increase appeal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere are some techniques that successful direct-marketing companies use to get orders or increase the size of their orders.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntroduce a trade-up offer. A company might offer. for example. that for an additional $35. the customer can get... \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer special packaging. This might include holiday. birthday. or\nother special-event gift wrapping. or unique. reusable boxes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPresent a compatible item. After a sale is made on prescription\nsunglasses. for instance. try to sell the customer a second pair of\nglasses at a discount.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer an extension. New-car dealers and home-appliance retailers.\nfor example, offer extended warranties or extended service contracts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMake selective price increases. You might try raising prices of hard to-get\nor hard-to-find products.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncrease minimum-order requirements. If you're a business-to business\noffice supply marketer. try increasing the minimum\npurchase requirements on selected products.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer bulk discounts. Some of your customers will respond to bulk\npurchases if they get price breaks from you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer a premium on specific purchases. For some customers. a free\ngift will convince them to buy from you. For example. you could give\nthe customer a free can of auto polish when he or she purchases an\nelectric buffer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntroduce 'bundle' deals. Computer marketers have increased sales\nby making 'bundled' offers -- e.g., offering a computer. a printer.\nsoftware, and paper at a lower price than what the total cost of the\nseparate items would be.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReferrals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost people and businesses spend all of their time, effort and money on conventional marketing, advertising or selling programs when a fraction of that effort, and virtually no expense, would get them many times the results if they developed a formalized referral system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReferral Systems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStep One: Every time clients deal with you in person, through your sales staff, by letter, e-mail or on the phone, diplomatically ask them for client referrals. But first you must set the stage.\n\nTell your clients that you realize you enjoy doing business with them and they probably associate with other people like themselves who mirror their values and quality.\n\nTell them you’d like to extend to them the opportunity of referring their valued and trusted associates to you.\n\nThen help the client see a clear picture of who in their lives could benefit most effectively, and naturally, from your services or products.\n\nTell them what kind of person or business it might be, where they are, what they are probably doing – and why they’d be benefited. \n\nShow them what that person or entity  would be doing or buying right now so that the picture is vivid. Then extend a totally risk-free, totally obligation-free sales offer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStep Two: Willingly offer to confer with, review, advise or at least talk or meet with anyone important to that client. \n\nOffer to consult their referral or let them sample or get a demonstration of your product or service in action without expectation of purchase, so your client sees you as a valuable expert with whom they can put their friends or colleagues in touch.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA formal client referral system will bring you an immediate increase in clients and profit. And it doesn’t cost anything to implement it.\n\nA referral-generated client normally spends more money, buys more often, is more profitable and loyal than most other categories of business you could go after.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAcquiring clients at a \nbreak even upfront\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGuaranteing purchases \nwith risk reversal\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHost beneficiary /Strategic Alliances/\nEndorsers/ Distribution channels\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvertising\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUsing direct mail / email\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are four types of direct mail promotions:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Direct sales (asking for the order)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Lead generating (asking for an inquiry)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Third-party endorsements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Database marketing (mailing to your own customers)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRunning special events \nand Information nights\r\n\t\t\t\t\tacquiring qualified lists\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUnique Selling Proposition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYour Unique Selling Proposition is that distinct, appealing idea that sets your business apart from every other 'me too' competitor.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnique Selling Proposition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour Unique Selling Proposition is that distinct, appealing idea that sets your business apart from every other “me too” competitor.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExamples\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDominos Pizza - Hot, juicy, delicious pizza – delivered to your door in thirty minutes or less – or it’s yours absolutely free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the 1960’s Avis was struggling to come up with a marketing approach that would gain them the market advantage that they desired. They needed a Unique Selling Proposition that was very powerful. After all, Hertz was heads above them in size and in market share.\n\nWhat did they do? They came up with a USP: “We’re Number Two – We Try Harder” – and they demonstrated that by extending themselves, by working harder, by giving better rates, by being more cordial and courteous.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNordstroms built their department store success through one basic, unique selling proposition. If you have any problem with a purchase, for any reason, bring it back for a no questions asked, 100% money back refund – anytime in the future. Anytime in the\nfuture, not in three days, not in seven days, not in thirty days. If a year later you’re dissatisfied – if five years you’re dissatisfied – IT’S NO PROBLEM.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial advisor Howard Ruff built a twenty million dollar newsletter empire back in the eighties, by putting himself in a unique and a distinctive position in his market place. \n\nMost of the other financial advisers took the position that they were big time Wall Street pros. And they were trying to appeal only to the affluent investors.\n\nHoward took the opposite approach – he said “I am the financial adviser to the middle class. And I want to protect your interests at a different level. I know how hard you work to make a dollar. I know how important it is that you don’t lose it. \n\nI know how critical your retirement monies are to you. I respect and I approach your situation\ndifferently than anybody else.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are many kinds of USP successes:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Some companies position themselves as having the best selection or broadest array of buying options. Their USP is 'broad choice.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther companies may offer more limited selection, but their USP is 'low price' or 'low markup.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother company may decide they don't want to be known for just price or selection, so instead they offer the finest quality at a higher. but still reasonable price. Quality or exclusivity -- even snob appeal -- is its USP.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStill, another firm may offer a product at reasonable prices, but their distinct selling appeal is that they offer better service, assistance, or installation help.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIncrease perception with \nBetter client education\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUse PR and Media Management\r\n\t\t\t\t\tImprove your consultative & advisory skills \nwith everyone in your organization\r\n\t\t\t\t\tQualifying leads upfront\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPut out irresistible offers\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunicating more frequently \nwith your existing clients\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliver higher than \nexpected levels of service\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEducating your clients by giving \nthem the reasons why\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTelemarketing / Phone sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'What kind of product or service lends Itself to telemarketing? \nThe answer has 3 parts:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. It should be a unit with a high price.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. There should be enough markup In It to pay the telemarketers a good commission.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. After all expenses are taken out there should be a healthy profit left.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn to ask questions as you talk to prospects. It's the best way to sell. Keep the\nfollowing nine points in mind as you refine your telephone skills:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Develop a plan. Before placing a call, be aware of exactly what it is you want to learn before the call is over.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Prepare a list of topics to cover. Have a specific question under each topic.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Ask permission. It's common courtesy to ask the customer's permission to ask questions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Time questions properly. Avoid making your presentation sound like an interrogation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Begin with broad questions that relax the prospect and 'get the ball rolling.' Then your questions can become more specific as the prospect reveals certain needs and concerns.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Build upon previous answers. Your feedback shows the prospect that you're listening.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7. Balance the number and type of questions. Though asking too few questions isn't a good practice, too many questions can make the prospect impatient for you to 'get to the point:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8. Don't ask manipulative questions (e.g., 'of course you would like to save 60% on your materials' costs, wouldn't you?'). They Insult the prospect's Intelligence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9. Be relaxed and conversational. Always let the prospect finish talking. Listen carefully.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\there are some pointers:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn telephone sales, you don't have the advantage of body language so tone of voice and rate of speech are critical. A good personality, the ability to build confidence, and to be in charge and to work towards a close are necessary for phone sales.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou must get through to the right person 'C the one who makes the buying decision. Expect to be confronted and rejected by many secretaries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tListen to what the other person is saying. Then respond to his or her needs accordingly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswer questions by asking questions. 'If I understand you correctly, you would be interested If...Is that correct?' Or, 'If I could provide this service for you at a price below market with no risk on your part, is there any reason why we couldn't do business?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead back information. Don't assume the person you're talking to understands. Keep asking, 'Am I making myself clear?' ...Does this make sense to you?'.. .\"Don't you agree?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't try to sell anything that's too technical or complicated over the telephone. Keep it simple.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsk for action. Offer a choice between two alternatives. Anticipate objections. Make it easy to say 'yes' and difficult to say 'no.' Use post-purchase reassurance as soon as you've sold the customer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFollow up a telephone purchasing commitment in writing. Verbal commitments are quickly forgotten.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBuilding A Powerful Sales Force\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere are some guidelines for getting the most from your salespeople:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMake sure salespeople understand that you won't settle for less than\na 100% commitment from them. If your sales reps aren't the best\nsalespeople they can be, they will never sell at their maximum\npotential.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEncourage reps to emulate a top-selling sales rep. By using a\nrespected, hlgh-performing salesperson as a role model, sales reps\ncan pick up the techniques that lead to success.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe sales rep should develop a pre-call selling plan whlch Is based\non the known characteristics and needs of each specific customer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Reps should attempt to encourage buyers to discuss their problems\nand needs. Once the salesperson can get buyers to talk about their\nproblems as they relate to the product, the sale Is practically made.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo generate repeat business, your salespeople have to demonstrate\nto buyers that they are better than anyone else at fulfilling needs\nand solving problems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Reps should have quick access to Information -- both from within\nand outside your company.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe seven motivational forces to which people respond are:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Acceptance: People want to be reassured that they are needed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccomplishment: They derive pleasure from a task completed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnvironment: They have great desire for pleasant surroundings and friendly associates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecognition: They need praise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResponsibility: They want authority.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSecurity: They are deeply concerned about the future.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStatus: Status symbols impress them. They want status.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTips for coaching your sales force\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Don't criticize. Instead, provide salespeople with 'how to' advice. Repeatedly tell them what you llke about their performance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Build their self-confidence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Ask questions. By asking questions. the sales manager gets the salespeople actively involved.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Build on your strengths. Take advantage of training materials that might help struggling salespeople.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Pressure the salespersons to evaluate themselves. This Is the first step In getting salespeople to traIn themselves.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Always come to an agreement about what corrective action to take to Improve.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7. Keep records. Set specific standards of performance and make sure they're being met within stated time limits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMaking the most out of Rejection\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Find out why. A rejection can be educational if you find out the reason -- be it logical or frivolous.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Find out if the competition is meeting the customer's needs. and learn how. It is crucial to identify. pinpoint. and satisfy customer learn how. It is crucial to identify. pinpoint. and satisfy customer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Exit gracefully from a non-productive sales call because time is the salesperson's most Important asset. Identify sales calls that are mistakes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. See the interview from the buyer's perspective. Listen 'between the lines.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Leave the door open. Try to end the sales calion a positive note\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSIX KEY SfRATEGIES FOR DEALING WITH REJECTION\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Divorce your ego from the sale. Remember that the prospect is not attacking you personally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Realize that the 'intimidating' prospect you are facing may have a lot of problems.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Don't automatically assume the problem is on your end.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Plant a lot of seeds. Salespeople who generate a lot of activity have little time to mourn over the loss of one sale.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Anticipate rejection so you won't be overwhelmed by it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Give failure minimal attention and keep on calling.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tELEVEN TOP-NOTCH SUGGESTIONS\nTO IMPROVE YOUR LiSTENING SKILLS\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Let your customers tell their stories first.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Remember that you can't listen and talk at the same time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Listen for psychological needs. These are needs other than what the prospect may mention,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Listen for the main ideas. What is central to the prospect?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Don't lose concentration and miss the speaker's main message.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Take brief notes regarding important data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7. React to the message -- not the person. Don't allow your mental impressions of the speaker to influence your reaction.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8. Listen selectively. Listen in such a way that you can uncover hidden messages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9. Relax. When the prospect speaks, try to put them at ease,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10. Don't criticize your customer's point of view.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11. Listen attentively and ask good questions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRisk Reversal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe BTRF guarantee enables you to do something that a basic guarantee or risk reversal approach does not. \n\nWhen you utilize a better than risk-free guarantee you are acknowledging and rewarding the client for the value of both his/her time and faith expended in favoring you with his/her purchasing decision.\n\nWhen you tell me that if I am dissatisfied for any reason whatsoever. You will not only give me full and immediate return of my purchase price, but you promise me an additional reward on top – a compensation incentive for having taken the time, effort and faith to purchase in the first place – I’m impressed. \n\nI’m hard-pressed to say “no” to a\nproposition like that.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhenever two parties come together to transact business of any kind, one side is always asking the other (consciously or otherwise) to assume more or all of the risk. If you ask someone to take on all the risk, their first inclination is not to buy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExamples\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDid you ever subscribe to a magazine or a newsletter and the reason you subscribed was because they gave you a 30, 60 or 90-day, no-questions-asked, 100% money-back guarantee? Or even not ask you to pay up front? That’s risk reversal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs president of Chrysler, Lee Iaccoca took only a $1 annual salary and stock options that would pay off only if he improved the company’s bottom line.\r\n\t\t\t2.

Price inducements for frequency\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first thing to do is send a letter within five days or a week from the time of your customer's first transaction where you:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Thank them:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Resell the value of your company\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Reassure them of the prudence of purchasing the product or service\n(if that can be identified).\r\n\t\t\t\tSpend everything you can Justify to bring in a customer as long as the customer costs you less than he/she earns you. If you feel you can't afford to spend more than the entire initial sale profit to get a customer, just remember that you'll be making money on him/her In a few months. Start out spending only what your cash-flow can justlfy, but after a quarter or two of reorder profits, step up the ad budget.\r\n\t\t\t\tYour best prospects are your existing customers. If you've been putting all your marketing efforts into acquiring new customers, stop and divert some of your resources into reselling, upselling, and cross-selling to those same customers.\r\n\t\t\t\tCurrent buyers (after they buy)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tacknowledge them?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak to them differently?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdo you truly fall in love with them?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdo you treat them special?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdo you analyze categories of buyers?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsegment you never targeted?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare you leveraging success stories?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare you trying to get media?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposting on website?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes you look more powerful\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare you trying to be a thought leader?\r\n\t\t3 Advanced Ways To Grow A Business\r\n\t\t\tPenetrate one new market or distribution channel every year\r\n\t\t\t\tStart with your general or vertical market products and ask, can they be taken to other markets?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tget ideas from looking at the profile of  your current buyers first\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLook for how many or alternative ways to reach your market or how what you have can be as is, with modification or combination be taken to other markets\r\n\t\t\tCreate at least one new product or service every year\r\n\t\t\t\tstart by looking at your buyers\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore\r\n\t\t\t\t\tduring\r\n\t\t\t\t\tafter\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead\r\n\t\t\t\tcome up with macro concept\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA product from scratch takes more time, logistics\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo searches and find people who have expertise with products but poor sales people or marketers and acquire the rights an exact to what they have exact or modified \r\n\t\t\t\tuse new products or \nservices on high or low end\r\n\t\t\t\t\thigher end offers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater part of selling cycles when trust is established\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoaching, packages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next program offers the next one and so on\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can package on frontend or bonus\r\n\t\t\tAcquire assets, buyers, intellectual property, brand of competitive or complementary business every year on a pure performance based payout\r\n\t\t\t\tstart start generic with the list buyers and ask what they buy...\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore\r\n\t\t\t\t\tduring\r\n\t\t\t\t\tafter\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead\r\n\t\t\t\tlist of companies in those fields\r\n\t\t\t\t\tyour problem is the solution to somebody else's problem\r\n\t\t\t\t\tshow them they will make a lot more with you than doing it by themselves\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif possible, go to larger companies\r\n\t\t\t\t\tapproach on doing an earn out, percentage on sales or \nflat rate that is based on sales generated\r\n\t\tThe Power Parthenon of Geometric Growth\r\n\t\t\tsystematically adding Revenue \nor market impact pillars \r\n\t\t\t\tDirect Sales\r\n\t\t\t\tTelemarketing\r\n\t\t\t\tReferral Systems\r\n\t\t\t\tJoint Ventures/Strategic Alliances/Partner Deals\r\n\t\t\t\tDirect Mail\r\n\t\t\t\tAdvertising\r\n\t\t\t\tDevelop and back end and front end\r\n\t\t\t\tEndorsements\r\n\t\t\t1 pillar at a time\r\n\t\t\t\tyou can do it small and safe in the beginning\r\n\t\t\t\tlow, slow, safe and small\r\n\t\t\t\tget the model working first\r\n\t\tMore action items from the book\r\n\t\t\tStep one Is to upsell or resell right at. or Immediately after, the Initial sale, preferably at the polnt of purchase.\r\n\t\t\tContact or visit a customer right after the sale to see how they like their purchase, and\noffer them a deal on a related product or service.\r\n\t\t\tSecure the rights to high-profit or repeat-type products or services that are logically\nsuited to your new customers, then follow up with calls, visits or mailings to sell those\nother products.\r\n\t\t\tIf you don't want to push other people's products or services, you can turn over your\nleads or prospects to other companies whose products or services are compatible, and\ntake a flat fee per lead or a percentage,\r\n\t\t\tIf you have a consumable, repeat-sale product or service, set up a regular monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual contact strategy, based on testing.\r\n\t\t\tBe the first to approach them about new products or merchandise you are willing to\nreserve for them, if they'll call you, come In, or send back the card.\r\n\t\t\tThe most profitable thing you'll ever do for your business is to understand and ethically\nexploit the marginal net worth of a customer?\r\n\t\t\t\tIf you haven't calculated your customer's marginal net worth yet, here's how to do it:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Compute your average sale and your profit per sale.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Compute how much additional profit a customer is worth to you by determining how many times he/she comes back. Be conservative.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Compute precisely what a customer costs by dividing the marketing budget by the number of customers it produces.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Compute the cost of a prospect the same way.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Compute how many sales you get for so many prospects (the percentage of prospects who become customers).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6. Compute the marginal net worth of a customer by subtracting the cost to produce (or convert) him/her from the profit you expect to earn from him/her over the lifetime of his/her patronage.\r\n\t\t\tAnother method you can use to boost your profits is telemarketing. What would happen, for example, If somebody from a company you're familiar with, whom you liked and trusted and had a good relationship with, called you up and offered you a proposition on either a product or service, or a package (a combination of products or services) that was only being made available to an exclusive group of customers, and not normally available, or an item that was not normally stocked, but that the store could manage to get If you were really interested in it? Chances are, If it were something you were excited about, you'd probably agree to purchase it.\r\n\t\t\tJay also believes that business owners must observe their customers closely to clearly understand their needs,\r\n\t\t\t\tOnce I spent the entire day with a client who taught me more than I taught him. I relearned an important lesson I had forgotten. The lesson was to get back in touch with the real, live pulse of your marketplace.\r\n\t\t\t\tI mean actually go onto the selling floor and handle two or three dozen sales transactions once a week to better comprehend what the customers' interests really are and what turns them on.\r\n\t\t\t\tYou should take customer service calls once a day and re-read all the indicative customer complaints that are received.\r\n\tEducation based marketing\r\n\t\tThe cornerstone of your marketing plan (according to Jay) should be to educate your client. You first educate them on your product or service.\r\n\t\tTake your customer by the hand\r\n\t\t\tPeople need to be explicitly told how to act to obtain your product or service. Therefore-\n- and this In Incredibly important -- every sales call. letter. commercial. or personal\ncontact should make the case for your product. Give prospects a brief education. then\ntake them by the hand, figuratively speaking, and tell them what specific action to take\nnext.\r\n\t\t\tIf you're selling an impulse item, or if the offer is for a limited time. tell your prospect to get in touch with you immediately. And don't be abstract. If you deal by phone. tell them to pick up the phone and call a specific number.\r\n\t\tTell them why\r\n\t\t\tWhenever you make an offer. ask for a sale, run an ad. have a salesperson make a proposition to a customer or prospect. or offer a product or service for sale at a specific price. always tell the reason why.\r\n\t\t\t\tWhy can you sell a product or service at a lower price than your competitor? Is it lower overhead or volume buying? Do you buy odd-lot inventories? Do you not give all the services? Why is your price so good?\r\n\t\t\t\tIf your price is high, tell the customer or prospect why. Do you offer a product far superior than the norm? Is your product made with demonstrably finer materials? Is your product designed to last or perform 2 1/2 times longer than your competitors?\r\n\t\t\t\tWhy is your price high? Is it handmade? Is it made twice as durable. or with three times the personal stitching or handiwork of some machine-made similar product?\r\n\t\t\t\tIf your price or the package is an especially appealing value, tell me (the customer) why you're making this offer. Is it because I'm going to order from you for the first time. and it's an exclusive offer to first-time customers? Or, is it because you got a great purchase on all or part of the components in the package. and you want to pass the savings on? Or, is it because you're overstocked and you want to get your capital out of slower moving inventory. so you're willing to sell at a loss.\r\n\t\tMake yourself into an expert\r\n\t\t\tReposition your company as the source for Industry information -- as the expert In the Industry -- and you'll be amazed at the Increase in business that results.\r\n\t\t\tFirst, do some homework.

It’s like having a blank check to fill in. It allows you to acquire products and services now, but pay for them much later. And the longer you take to pay, the less it ends up costing you.

Do the\nsame with direct-mailing pieces that come to your home or office. Record all the good TV commercials that convince you to buy -- especIally the ones that almost convince you even though you don't need the product.\r\n\t\t\tStep #2 - Observe\nSpend weekends and evenings shopping. Note the conduct. personalities, and actions\nof retailers and service companies. Keep a notebook In your pocket for Jotting down Ideas\nand observations. Every time something irritates you, make a note of it. Every time something delights and pleases you, write It down.\r\n\t\t\tStep #3 - Get Involved\nAsk your customers questions. Go out In the field and spend some time as a salesperson. Find what your prospects really want -- and what their major sales objections are. Spend one day a week working the customer service phone or counter. Go out on service calls.\r\n\t\t\tStep #4 - Play Customer\nOrder something from your own company under an assumed name and see how the average customer Is treated. Complain about the purchase and see how your problem Is handled. Do the same thing with your competition and observe how their treatment differs from or Is similar to your company's.\r\n\t\t\tStep #5 - Listen\nLet your employees share with you their observations and opinions, and pay close attention to what they say. Call customers and ask questions about your performance, Image, conduct, etc.\r\n\t\t\tStep #6 - Nurture Ideas\nEncourage your marketing people, sales manager, ad people, etc. to try a lot of new Ideas,\nconcepts, approaches, offers and packages. \r\n\t\t\tStep #7 - Show People You Care\nAcknowledge your staff, your customers, your vendors, Don't forget about past customers and the prospects you don't sell. Service the Living daylights out of everyone -- no holds barred, Follow up on inquiries. Follow up on delayed orders. Follow up on problems. Follow up after every sale.\r\n\t\t\tStep #8 - Learn From Others\nKeep a notebook at home, at the office, in the car. Whenever you observe a powerful marketing technique that captivates you -- makes you want or crave or respond to a product or service -- Jot down the concept, approach, language, sales pitch, etc. that captivated you and incorporate similar or related techniques into your marketing tests. A great marketer picks the brains of peers, competitors, employees, and retired colleagues.\r\n\t\t\tStep #9 - Test, Test, Test\n* Test as many premises and concepts as possible. Test your promises.\n* Test various media to determine which ones give you the most leveraged return for your ad dollar.\n* Test various headlines or their equivalents.\n* Test the size of your mailings, and the length of your sales pitches.\n* Test your packaging.\n* Test the 'marginal net worth' of customers and prospects.\n* Test your sales approach and varying scripts.\n* Test commercials.\n\nNever, ever stop testing and retesting. Your marketing will never stop improving.\nRemember also that profit is a function of time. Speed up the process of testing and\nevaluation, and you can leverage your return 5, 10. 100 times.\r\n\t\t\tStep #10 - Improve The Best. Not The Worst\nAlso, remember this: Most marketers spend far too much time, effort, and money trying to revive or salvage products that are in trouble or are not viable -- and far too little time worrying about how\nto make successful products or services even more successful. A truly brave world-class marketer looks at unfavorable test results in the face, cut losses, and move on to new products, services, or concepts.\r\n\t\t\tStep #11 - Don't Shout\nGood advertising, good sales letters, good sales pitches -- good overall marketing successfully sells the product or service without drawing attention to Itself.\r\n\t\t\tStep # 12 - Be Compelling\nThink about the ads, sales letters, or sales pitches that compelled you to buy. If they are truly compelling, you become immersed in the facts, benefits, or explanation of construction or performance and forget that you are reading a sales pitch.\r\n\t\t\tStep #13 - The Idea Is Everything\nA great marketer learns quickly that what you say is Infinitely more important than how you say it. Marketing is effective because of content, not form. A great concept will transcend mediocre copy. Great copy will not transcend a bad concept. Focus your attention and effort on developing great concepts. Find the biggest, most believable, embraceable, and honest promise possible.\r\n\t\t\tStep #14 - Give 'Emn The Facts\n\nPack as many facts as possible into all of your marketing. Few advertisers give enough\nfacts to compellingly sell their products. A lot of Ignorant marketers believe prospective buyers aren't interested in learning all the facts they can about a product or service they're contemplating buying.\r\n\t\t\tStep # 15 - Keep A Good Thing Going\n\nOnce you come up with great marketing, you will tire of It far earlier than the\nmarketplace. Too many marketers kill their ads, stop their mailings, or try and change their\nsalespeople's pitches because they are tired of hearing them, The marketplace Is not.\r\n\t\tNine Drivers Of Exponential Growth\r\n\t\t\tMarketing\r\n\t\t\t\tYOu have activities that are marketing actions, tactics & Strategies\r\n\t\t\t\t\tModels\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvehicles\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMessage\r\n\t\t\t\t\tProposition\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCTA\r\n\t\t\t\t\tProof \r\n\t\t\t\t\tOutcome for prospect\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRisk Reversal\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunication sequence\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmedia\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton target or off?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter ways to reach\r\n\t\t\t\t\theadlines\r\n\t\t\t\tAre you testing with various approaches that communicate benefit or gain control of a conversation through a question that provokes the prospect to give you control\r\n\t\t\t\tare you proving in your communication that your product does what you say?\r\n\t\t\t\tIs there a no or low risk way for them to take the first step?\r\n\t\t\t\tAre you following up with more constant advancing and enhancing communication?\r\n\t\t\t\tAre you using referral generating systems?\r\n\t\t\tStrategy\r\n\t\t\t\tChange your strategy, you change your results\r\n\t\t\t\tmost companies don't have one and operate tactical instead\r\n\t\t\t\tStrategy\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstart with break even\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstart with partnerships\r\n\t\t\t\tLook at different strategies out there\r\n\t\t\t\t\tborrow, adapt and adopt\r\n\t\t\tCapital\r\n\t\t\t\tdimensions\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMoney\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIntellectual\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRelational\r\n\t\t\t\t\thuman\r\n\t\t\t\t\tKnowledge\r\n\t\t\t\tIf you can't afford to acquire tech, expertise, resources etc, ask who has extra resources that you can partner with and/or pay for results\r\n\t\t\tBusiness Model\r\n\t\t\t\thow you would get the clients in the first place\r\n\t\t\t\tAsk yourself, what is your model and how does it feed and complement your overall strategy\r\n\t\t\t\tExamine different industries and learn their strategy\r\n\t\t\tRelationships\r\n\t\t\t\tHow can you identify all the people have direct access, compatibility and trust to your market that are not competitive to partner with\r\n\t\t\t\tHow many businesses/industries that reach your market before, during, after or instead?\r\n\t\t\t\tHow many people who sell an alternative means for past/inactive or non buyer prospects.\r\n\t\t\t\tMake a list of all relationships that you have that are influential\r\n\t\t\t\tInfluencers who have a bond with the market you serve\r\n\t\t\tDistribution Channels\r\n\t\t\t\tThere are many good products that do not have good distribution\r\n\t\t\t\tFind those that have good distribution for one thing and partner with them on other offers\r\n\t\t\t\tmailing list that someone else would pay money for and share of business\r\n\t\t\t\tendorse other people to your list\r\n\t\t\tProducts & Services\r\n\t\t\t\tThe effort it takes to acquire a buyer in the first is a huge investment, the effort to resell to them is lower\r\n\t\t\t\tpoint of sale, package, post sale that serve the buying profile to double or triple value of the client.\r\n\t\t\t\tmost companies do not understand that the faster you start the relationship, the faster the first sale.

A company might offer. for example. that for an additional $35. the customer can get... \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer special packaging. This might include holiday. birthday. or\nother special-event gift wrapping. or unique. reusable boxes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPresent a compatible item. After a sale is made on prescription\nsunglasses. for instance. try to sell the customer a second pair of\nglasses at a discount.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer an extension. New-car dealers and home-appliance retailers.\nfor example, offer extended warranties or extended service contracts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMake selective price increases. You might try raising prices of hard to-get\nor hard-to-find products.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncrease minimum-order requirements. If you're a business-to business\noffice supply marketer. try increasing the minimum\npurchase requirements on selected products.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer bulk discounts. Some of your customers will respond to bulk\npurchases if they get price breaks from you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer a premium on specific purchases. For some customers. a free\ngift will convince them to buy from you. For example. you could give\nthe customer a free can of auto polish when he or she purchases an\nelectric buffer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntroduce 'bundle' deals. Computer marketers have increased sales\nby making 'bundled' offers -- e.g., offering a computer. a printer.\nsoftware, and paper at a lower price than what the total cost of the\nseparate items would be.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReferrals\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost people and businesses spend all of their time, effort and money on conventional marketing, advertising or selling programs when a fraction of that effort, and virtually no expense, would get them many times the results if they developed a formalized referral system.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReferral Systems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStep One: Every time clients deal with you in person, through your sales staff, by letter, e-mail or on the phone, diplomatically ask them for client referrals. But first you must set the stage.\n\nTell your clients that you realize you enjoy doing business with them and they probably associate with other people like themselves who mirror their values and quality.\n\nTell them you’d like to extend to them the opportunity of referring their valued and trusted associates to you.\n\nThen help the client see a clear picture of who in their lives could benefit most effectively, and naturally, from your services or products.\n\nTell them what kind of person or business it might be, where they are, what they are probably doing – and why they’d be benefited. \n\nShow them what that person or entity  would be doing or buying right now so that the picture is vivid. Then extend a totally risk-free, totally obligation-free sales offer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStep Two: Willingly offer to confer with, review, advise or at least talk or meet with anyone important to that client. \n\nOffer to consult their referral or let them sample or get a demonstration of your product or service in action without expectation of purchase, so your client sees you as a valuable expert with whom they can put their friends or colleagues in touch.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA formal client referral system will bring you an immediate increase in clients and profit. And it doesn’t cost anything to implement it.\n\nA referral-generated client normally spends more money, buys more often, is more profitable and loyal than most other categories of business you could go after.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAcquiring clients at a \nbreak even upfront\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGuaranteing purchases \nwith risk reversal\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHost beneficiary /Strategic Alliances/\nEndorsers/ Distribution channels\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvertising\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUsing direct mail / email\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are four types of direct mail promotions:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Direct sales (asking for the order)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Lead generating (asking for an inquiry)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Third-party endorsements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Database marketing (mailing to your own customers)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRunning special events \nand Information nights\r\n\t\t\t\t\tacquiring qualified lists\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUnique Selling Proposition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYour Unique Selling Proposition is that distinct, appealing idea that sets your business apart from every other 'me too' competitor.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnique Selling Proposition\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour Unique Selling Proposition is that distinct, appealing idea that sets your business apart from every other “me too” competitor.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExamples\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDominos Pizza - Hot, juicy, delicious pizza – delivered to your door in thirty minutes or less – or it’s yours absolutely free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the 1960’s Avis was struggling to come up with a marketing approach that would gain them the market advantage that they desired. They needed a Unique Selling Proposition that was very powerful. After all, Hertz was heads above them in size and in market share.\n\nWhat did they do? They came up with a USP: “We’re Number Two – We Try Harder” – and they demonstrated that by extending themselves, by working harder, by giving better rates, by being more cordial and courteous.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNordstroms built their department store success through one basic, unique selling proposition. If you have any problem with a purchase, for any reason, bring it back for a no questions asked, 100% money back refund – anytime in the future. Anytime in the\nfuture, not in three days, not in seven days, not in thirty days. If a year later you’re dissatisfied – if five years you’re dissatisfied – IT’S NO PROBLEM.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancial advisor Howard Ruff built a twenty million dollar newsletter empire back in the eighties, by putting himself in a unique and a distinctive position in his market place. \n\nMost of the other financial advisers took the position that they were big time Wall Street pros. And they were trying to appeal only to the affluent investors.\n\nHoward took the opposite approach – he said “I am the financial adviser to the middle class. And I want to protect your interests at a different level. I know how hard you work to make a dollar. I know how important it is that you don’t lose it. \n\nI know how critical your retirement monies are to you. I respect and I approach your situation\ndifferently than anybody else.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are many kinds of USP successes:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Some companies position themselves as having the best selection or broadest array of buying options. Their USP is 'broad choice.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOther companies may offer more limited selection, but their USP is 'low price' or 'low markup.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother company may decide they don't want to be known for just price or selection, so instead they offer the finest quality at a higher. but still reasonable price. Quality or exclusivity -- even snob appeal -- is its USP.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStill, another firm may offer a product at reasonable prices, but their distinct selling appeal is that they offer better service, assistance, or installation help.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIncrease perception with \nBetter client education\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUse PR and Media Management\r\n\t\t\t\t\tImprove your consultative & advisory skills \nwith everyone in your organization\r\n\t\t\t\t\tQualifying leads upfront\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPut out irresistible offers\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcommunicating more frequently \nwith your existing clients\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdeliver higher than \nexpected levels of service\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEducating your clients by giving \nthem the reasons why\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTelemarketing / Phone sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'What kind of product or service lends Itself to telemarketing? \nThe answer has 3 parts:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. It should be a unit with a high price.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. There should be enough markup In It to pay the telemarketers a good commission.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. After all expenses are taken out there should be a healthy profit left.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn to ask questions as you talk to prospects. It's the best way to sell. Keep the\nfollowing nine points in mind as you refine your telephone skills:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Develop a plan. Before placing a call, be aware of exactly what it is you want to learn before the call is over.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Prepare a list of topics to cover. Have a specific question under each topic.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Ask permission. It's common courtesy to ask the customer's permission to ask questions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Time questions properly. Avoid making your presentation sound like an interrogation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Begin with broad questions that relax the prospect and 'get the ball rolling.' Then your questions can become more specific as the prospect reveals certain needs and concerns.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Build upon previous answers. Your feedback shows the prospect that you're listening.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7. Balance the number and type of questions. Though asking too few questions isn't a good practice, too many questions can make the prospect impatient for you to 'get to the point:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8. Don't ask manipulative questions (e.g., 'of course you would like to save 60% on your materials' costs, wouldn't you?'). They Insult the prospect's Intelligence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9. Be relaxed and conversational. Always let the prospect finish talking. Listen carefully.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\there are some pointers:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn telephone sales, you don't have the advantage of body language so tone of voice and rate of speech are critical. A good personality, the ability to build confidence, and to be in charge and to work towards a close are necessary for phone sales.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou must get through to the right person 'C the one who makes the buying decision. Expect to be confronted and rejected by many secretaries\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tListen to what the other person is saying. Then respond to his or her needs accordingly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswer questions by asking questions. 'If I understand you correctly, you would be interested If...Is that correct?' Or, 'If I could provide this service for you at a price below market with no risk on your part, is there any reason why we couldn't do business?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead back information. Don't assume the person you're talking to understands. Keep asking, 'Am I making myself clear?' ...Does this make sense to you?'.. .\"Don't you agree?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't try to sell anything that's too technical or complicated over the telephone. Keep it simple.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsk for action. Offer a choice between two alternatives. Anticipate objections. Make it easy to say 'yes' and difficult to say 'no.' Use post-purchase reassurance as soon as you've sold the customer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFollow up a telephone purchasing commitment in writing. Verbal commitments are quickly forgotten.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBuilding A Powerful Sales Force\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere are some guidelines for getting the most from your salespeople:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMake sure salespeople understand that you won't settle for less than\na 100% commitment from them. If your sales reps aren't the best\nsalespeople they can be, they will never sell at their maximum\npotential.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEncourage reps to emulate a top-selling sales rep. By using a\nrespected, hlgh-performing salesperson as a role model, sales reps\ncan pick up the techniques that lead to success.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe sales rep should develop a pre-call selling plan whlch Is based\non the known characteristics and needs of each specific customer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Reps should attempt to encourage buyers to discuss their problems\nand needs. Once the salesperson can get buyers to talk about their\nproblems as they relate to the product, the sale Is practically made.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo generate repeat business, your salespeople have to demonstrate\nto buyers that they are better than anyone else at fulfilling needs\nand solving problems\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Reps should have quick access to Information -- both from within\nand outside your company.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe seven motivational forces to which people respond are:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Acceptance: People want to be reassured that they are needed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccomplishment: They derive pleasure from a task completed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnvironment: They have great desire for pleasant surroundings and friendly associates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecognition: They need praise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResponsibility: They want authority.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSecurity: They are deeply concerned about the future.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStatus: Status symbols impress them. They want status.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTips for coaching your sales force\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Don't criticize. Instead, provide salespeople with 'how to' advice. Repeatedly tell them what you llke about their performance.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Build their self-confidence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Ask questions. By asking questions. the sales manager gets the salespeople actively involved.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Build on your strengths. Take advantage of training materials that might help struggling salespeople.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Pressure the salespersons to evaluate themselves. This Is the first step In getting salespeople to traIn themselves.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Always come to an agreement about what corrective action to take to Improve.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7. Keep records. Set specific standards of performance and make sure they're being met within stated time limits.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMaking the most out of Rejection\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Find out why. A rejection can be educational if you find out the reason -- be it logical or frivolous.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Find out if the competition is meeting the customer's needs. and learn how. It is crucial to identify. pinpoint. and satisfy customer learn how. It is crucial to identify. pinpoint. and satisfy customer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Exit gracefully from a non-productive sales call because time is the salesperson's most Important asset. Identify sales calls that are mistakes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. See the interview from the buyer's perspective. Listen 'between the lines.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Leave the door open. Try to end the sales calion a positive note\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSIX KEY SfRATEGIES FOR DEALING WITH REJECTION\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Divorce your ego from the sale. Remember that the prospect is not attacking you personally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Realize that the 'intimidating' prospect you are facing may have a lot of problems.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Don't automatically assume the problem is on your end.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Plant a lot of seeds. Salespeople who generate a lot of activity have little time to mourn over the loss of one sale.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Anticipate rejection so you won't be overwhelmed by it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Give failure minimal attention and keep on calling.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tELEVEN TOP-NOTCH SUGGESTIONS\nTO IMPROVE YOUR LiSTENING SKILLS\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Let your customers tell their stories first.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Remember that you can't listen and talk at the same time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Listen for psychological needs. These are needs other than what the prospect may mention,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Listen for the main ideas. What is central to the prospect?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Don't lose concentration and miss the speaker's main message.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Take brief notes regarding important data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7. React to the message -- not the person. Don't allow your mental impressions of the speaker to influence your reaction.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8. Listen selectively. Listen in such a way that you can uncover hidden messages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9. Relax. When the prospect speaks, try to put them at ease,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10. Don't criticize your customer's point of view.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11. Listen attentively and ask good questions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRisk Reversal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe BTRF guarantee enables you to do something that a basic guarantee or risk reversal approach does not. \n\nWhen you utilize a better than risk-free guarantee you are acknowledging and rewarding the client for the value of both his/her time and faith expended in favoring you with his/her purchasing decision.\n\nWhen you tell me that if I am dissatisfied for any reason whatsoever. You will not only give me full and immediate return of my purchase price, but you promise me an additional reward on top – a compensation incentive for having taken the time, effort and faith to purchase in the first place – I’m impressed. \n\nI’m hard-pressed to say “no” to a\nproposition like that.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhenever two parties come together to transact business of any kind, one side is always asking the other (consciously or otherwise) to assume more or all of the risk. If you ask someone to take on all the risk, their first inclination is not to buy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExamples\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDid you ever subscribe to a magazine or a newsletter and the reason you subscribed was because they gave you a 30, 60 or 90-day, no-questions-asked, 100% money-back guarantee? Or even not ask you to pay up front? That’s risk reversal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs president of Chrysler, Lee Iaccoca took only a $1 annual salary and stock options that would pay off only if he improved the company’s bottom line.\r\n\t\t\t2. Getting clients to ethically increase their \naverage purchase transaction value\r\n\t\t\t\tLarger units of sales\r\n\t\t\t\tcombinations\r\n\t\t\t\tUsing point of sale promotions or their equivalent\r\n\t\t\t\tBundling products \nand services together\r\n\t\t\t\tincreasing prices\r\n\t\t\t\tchanging your profile of your products and services\r\n\t\t\t\tOffering greater or larger units of purchase\r\n\t\t\t3. Increasing transaction frequency (Get more utilization out of the relationship)\r\n\t\t\t\t6 ways\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Develop a backend line of products and services\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. communicating personally with your clients\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Endorsing other products to your list\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Running special events\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Pre-framing or programming preeminently, your clients\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6. Price inducements for frequency\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first thing to do is send a letter within five days or a week from the time of your customer's first transaction where you:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Thank them:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Resell the value of your company\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Reassure them of the prudence of purchasing the product or service\n(if that can be identified).\r\n\t\t\t\tSpend everything you can Justify to bring in a customer as long as the customer costs you less than he/she earns you. If you feel you can't afford to spend more than the entire initial sale profit to get a customer, just remember that you'll be making money on him/her In a few months. Start out spending only what your cash-flow can justlfy, but after a quarter or two of reorder profits, step up the ad budget.\r\n\t\t\t\tYour best prospects are your existing customers. If you've been putting all your marketing efforts into acquiring new customers, stop and divert some of your resources into reselling, upselling, and cross-selling to those same customers.\r\n\t\t\t\tCurrent buyers (after they buy)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tacknowledge them?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak to them differently?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdo you truly fall in love with them?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdo you treat them special?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdo you analyze categories of buyers?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsegment you never targeted?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare you leveraging success stories?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare you trying to get media?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposting on website?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes you look more powerful\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare you trying to be a thought leader?\r\n\t\t3 Advanced Ways To Grow A Business\r\n\t\t\tPenetrate one new market or distribution channel every year\r\n\t\t\t\tStart with your general or vertical market products and ask, can they be taken to other markets?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tget ideas from looking at the profile of  your current buyers first\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLook for how many or alternative ways to reach your market or how what you have can be as is, with modification or combination be taken to other markets\r\n\t\t\tCreate at least one new product or service every year\r\n\t\t\t\tstart by looking at your buyers\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore\r\n\t\t\t\t\tduring\r\n\t\t\t\t\tafter\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead\r\n\t\t\t\tcome up with macro concept\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA product from scratch takes more time, logistics\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo searches and find people who have expertise with products but poor sales people or marketers and acquire the rights an exact to what they have exact or modified \r\n\t\t\t\tuse new products or \nservices on high or low end\r\n\t\t\t\t\thigher end offers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater part of selling cycles when trust is established\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoaching, packages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next program offers the next one and so on\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can package on frontend or bonus\r\n\t\t\tAcquire assets, buyers, intellectual property, brand of competitive or complementary business every year on a pure performance based payout\r\n\t\t\t\tstart start generic with the list buyers and ask what they buy...\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore\r\n\t\t\t\t\tduring\r\n\t\t\t\t\tafter\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead\r\n\t\t\t\tlist of companies in those fields\r\n\t\t\t\t\tyour problem is the solution to somebody else's problem\r\n\t\t\t\t\tshow them they will make a lot more with you than doing it by themselves\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif possible, go to larger companies\r\n\t\t\t\t\tapproach on doing an earn out, percentage on sales or \nflat rate that is based on sales generated\r\n\t\tThe Power Parthenon of Geometric Growth\r\n\t\t\tsystematically adding Revenue \nor market impact pillars \r\n\t\t\t\tDirect Sales\r\n\t\t\t\tTelemarketing\r\n\t\t\t\tReferral Systems\r\n\t\t\t\tJoint Ventures/Strategic Alliances/Partner Deals\r\n\t\t\t\tDirect Mail\r\n\t\t\t\tAdvertising\r\n\t\t\t\tDevelop and back end and front end\r\n\t\t\t\tEndorsements\r\n\t\t\t1 pillar at a time\r\n\t\t\t\tyou can do it small and safe in the beginning\r\n\t\t\t\tlow, slow, safe and small\r\n\t\t\t\tget the model working first\r\n\t\tMore action items from the book\r\n\t\t\tStep one Is to upsell or resell right at. or Immediately after, the Initial sale, preferably at the polnt of purchase.\r\n\t\t\tContact or visit a customer right after the sale to see how they like their purchase, and\noffer them a deal on a related product or service.\r\n\t\t\tSecure the rights to high-profit or repeat-type products or services that are logically\nsuited to your new customers, then follow up with calls, visits or mailings to sell those\nother products.\r\n\t\t\tIf you don't want to push other people's products or services, you can turn over your\nleads or prospects to other companies whose products or services are compatible, and\ntake a flat fee per lead or a percentage,\r\n\t\t\tIf you have a consumable, repeat-sale product or service, set up a regular monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual contact strategy, based on testing.\r\n\t\t\tBe the first to approach them about new products or merchandise you are willing to\nreserve for them, if they'll call you, come In, or send back the card.\r\n\t\t\tThe most profitable thing you'll ever do for your business is to understand and ethically\nexploit the marginal net worth of a customer?\r\n\t\t\t\tIf you haven't calculated your customer's marginal net worth yet, here's how to do it:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Compute your average sale and your profit per sale.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Compute how much additional profit a customer is worth to you by determining how many times he/she comes back. Be conservative.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Compute precisely what a customer costs by dividing the marketing budget by the number of customers it produces.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Compute the cost of a prospect the same way.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Compute how many sales you get for so many prospects (the percentage of prospects who become customers).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6. Compute the marginal net worth of a customer by subtracting the cost to produce (or convert) him/her from the profit you expect to earn from him/her over the lifetime of his/her patronage.\r\n\t\t\tAnother method you can use to boost your profits is telemarketing. What would happen, for example, If somebody from a company you're familiar with, whom you liked and trusted and had a good relationship with, called you up and offered you a proposition on either a product or service, or a package (a combination of products or services) that was only being made available to an exclusive group of customers, and not normally available, or an item that was not normally stocked, but that the store could manage to get If you were really interested in it? Chances are, If it were something you were excited about, you'd probably agree to purchase it.\r\n\t\t\tJay also believes that business owners must observe their customers closely to clearly understand their needs,\r\n\t\t\t\tOnce I spent the entire day with a client who taught me more than I taught him. I relearned an important lesson I had forgotten. The lesson was to get back in touch with the real, live pulse of your marketplace.\r\n\t\t\t\tI mean actually go onto the selling floor and handle two or three dozen sales transactions once a week to better comprehend what the customers' interests really are and what turns them on.\r\n\t\t\t\tYou should take customer service calls once a day and re-read all the indicative customer complaints that are received.\r\n\tEducation based marketing\r\n\t\tThe cornerstone of your marketing plan (according to Jay) should be to educate your client. You first educate them on your product or service.\r\n\t\tTake your customer by the hand\r\n\t\t\tPeople need to be explicitly told how to act to obtain your product or service. Therefore-\n- and this In Incredibly important -- every sales call. letter. commercial. or personal\ncontact should make the case for your product. Give prospects a brief education. then\ntake them by the hand, figuratively speaking, and tell them what specific action to take\nnext.\r\n\t\t\tIf you're selling an impulse item, or if the offer is for a limited time. tell your prospect to get in touch with you immediately. And don't be abstract. If you deal by phone. tell them to pick up the phone and call a specific number.\r\n\t\tTell them why\r\n\t\t\tWhenever you make an offer. ask for a sale, run an ad. have a salesperson make a proposition to a customer or prospect. or offer a product or service for sale at a specific price. always tell the reason why.\r\n\t\t\t\tWhy can you sell a product or service at a lower price than your competitor?

Do the\nsame with direct-mailing pieces that come to your home or office. Record all the good TV commercials that convince you to buy -- especIally the ones that almost convince you even though you don't need the product.\r\n\t\t\tStep #2 - Observe\nSpend weekends and evenings shopping. Note the conduct. personalities, and actions\nof retailers and service companies. Keep a notebook In your pocket for Jotting down Ideas\nand observations. Every time something irritates you, make a note of it. Every time something delights and pleases you, write It down.\r\n\t\t\tStep #3 - Get Involved\nAsk your customers questions. Go out In the field and spend some time as a salesperson. Find what your prospects really want -- and what their major sales objections are. Spend one day a week working the customer service phone or counter. Go out on service calls.\r\n\t\t\tStep #4 - Play Customer\nOrder something from your own company under an assumed name and see how the average customer Is treated. Complain about the purchase and see how your problem Is handled. Do the same thing with your competition and observe how their treatment differs from or Is similar to your company's.\r\n\t\t\tStep #5 - Listen\nLet your employees share with you their observations and opinions, and pay close attention to what they say. Call customers and ask questions about your performance, Image, conduct, etc.\r\n\t\t\tStep #6 - Nurture Ideas\nEncourage your marketing people, sales manager, ad people, etc. to try a lot of new Ideas,\nconcepts, approaches, offers and packages. \r\n\t\t\tStep #7 - Show People You Care\nAcknowledge your staff, your customers, your vendors, Don't forget about past customers and the prospects you don't sell. Service the Living daylights out of everyone -- no holds barred, Follow up on inquiries. Follow up on delayed orders. Follow up on problems. Follow up after every sale.\r\n\t\t\tStep #8 - Learn From Others\nKeep a notebook at home, at the office, in the car. Whenever you observe a powerful marketing technique that captivates you -- makes you want or crave or respond to a product or service -- Jot down the concept, approach, language, sales pitch, etc. that captivated you and incorporate similar or related techniques into your marketing tests. A great marketer picks the brains of peers, competitors, employees, and retired colleagues.\r\n\t\t\tStep #9 - Test, Test, Test\n* Test as many premises and concepts as possible. Test your promises.\n* Test various media to determine which ones give you the most leveraged return for your ad dollar.\n* Test various headlines or their equivalents.\n* Test the size of your mailings, and the length of your sales pitches.\n* Test your packaging.\n* Test the 'marginal net worth' of customers and prospects.\n* Test your sales approach and varying scripts.\n* Test commercials.\n\nNever, ever stop testing and retesting. Your marketing will never stop improving.\nRemember also that profit is a function of time. Speed up the process of testing and\nevaluation, and you can leverage your return 5, 10. 100 times.\r\n\t\t\tStep #10 - Improve The Best. Not The Worst\nAlso, remember this: Most marketers spend far too much time, effort, and money trying to revive or salvage products that are in trouble or are not viable -- and far too little time worrying about how\nto make successful products or services even more successful. A truly brave world-class marketer looks at unfavorable test results in the face, cut losses, and move on to new products, services, or concepts.\r\n\t\t\tStep #11 - Don't Shout\nGood advertising, good sales letters, good sales pitches -- good overall marketing successfully sells the product or service without drawing attention to Itself.\r\n\t\t\tStep # 12 - Be Compelling\nThink about the ads, sales letters, or sales pitches that compelled you to buy. If they are truly compelling, you become immersed in the facts, benefits, or explanation of construction or performance and forget that you are reading a sales pitch.\r\n\t\t\tStep #13 - The Idea Is Everything\nA great marketer learns quickly that what you say is Infinitely more important than how you say it. Marketing is effective because of content, not form. A great concept will transcend mediocre copy. Great copy will not transcend a bad concept. Focus your attention and effort on developing great concepts. Find the biggest, most believable, embraceable, and honest promise possible.\r\n\t\t\tStep #14 - Give 'Emn The Facts\n\nPack as many facts as possible into all of your marketing. Few advertisers give enough\nfacts to compellingly sell their products.

      "text": "States of Mind\nNeville Goddard, Emmet Fox\r\n\tPremise\r\n\t\tLife is a state of consciousness - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tNow, look at it this way: see the whole vast world as infinite states. All states. If they are all states, and you are an immortal being– you are not a state; you are immortal– you enter a state and the state becomes alive. - Neville Goddard\r\n\t\tThere are as many universes as there are individuals to form them through thinking. - Emmet Fox\r\n\tBelief\r\n\t\tWe have to make the adjustment: think of an infinite number of states − anything you can think of – it exists now. Man passes through states, like a traveler who passes through places, through cities. - Neville Goddard\r\n\t\tSeek to understand why the thought drops you out of the state of mind and change the assumption within.\r\n\t\tThe outer world is the world of the unseen, the inner world is world of the seen. Belief and assumption makes the unseen seen to represent one of the infinite states of consciousness \r\n\t\tYour object is to drive the thought of the difficulty out of your consciousness - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tYour heart's Desire is the Voice of God, and that Voice must be obeyed sooner or later. - Emmet Fox\r\n\tAcceptance\r\n\t\tMan is a mental being, and to know this is the first step on the road to freedom and prosperity, for as long as you believe yourself to be primarily physical, a superior kind of animal, you will remain in bondage—in bondage, that is to say, to your own habits of thought, for there is no other bondage. - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tThe art of life is to live in the present moment and to make that moment as perfect as we can by the realization that we are the instruments and expression of God himself. - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tWhoever you are, wherever you may be, the golden key to harmony is in your hand now. - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tThe outer world represents consciousness externalized\r\n\t\tPeople represent an accurate image of our own consciousness.

All states. If they are all states, and you are an immortal being– you are not a state; you are immortal– you enter a state and the state becomes alive. - Neville Goddard\r\n\t\tThere are as many universes as there are individuals to form them through thinking. - Emmet Fox\r\n\tBelief\r\n\t\tWe have to make the adjustment: think of an infinite number of states − anything you can think of – it exists now. Man passes through states, like a traveler who passes through places, through cities. - Neville Goddard\r\n\t\tSeek to understand why the thought drops you out of the state of mind and change the assumption within.\r\n\t\tThe outer world is the world of the unseen, the inner world is world of the seen. Belief and assumption makes the unseen seen to represent one of the infinite states of consciousness \r\n\t\tYour object is to drive the thought of the difficulty out of your consciousness - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tYour heart's Desire is the Voice of God, and that Voice must be obeyed sooner or later. - Emmet Fox\r\n\tAcceptance\r\n\t\tMan is a mental being, and to know this is the first step on the road to freedom and prosperity, for as long as you believe yourself to be primarily physical, a superior kind of animal, you will remain in bondage—in bondage, that is to say, to your own habits of thought, for there is no other bondage. - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tThe art of life is to live in the present moment and to make that moment as perfect as we can by the realization that we are the instruments and expression of God himself. - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tWhoever you are, wherever you may be, the golden key to harmony is in your hand now. - Emmet Fox\r\n\t\tThe outer world represents consciousness externalized\r\n\t\tPeople represent an accurate image of our own consciousness.

      "text": "How To Make Our Mental Pictures Come True (George Schubel)\r\n\tPREPARING OUR THOUGHT-OBJECT FOR REPRODUCTION\r\n\t\tWe have confidently selected a certain definite mental object which by means of this method of deliberate visualizing has become the object of our heart's desire.\r\n\t\tOur formulating faculties have been at work specializing and differentiating our desire, it has been placed in the current of our objective thinking, and now has taken shape as an object of thought in the photographic studio of our objective minds.\r\n\t\tSeating ourselves in a comfortable arm-chair which will permit the greatest possible relaxation, or reclining on a couch, or lying in bed, we begin our practical work by bringing the \"object of our heart's desire.\r\n\t\t\tOur first consideration is the quiet, darkened room in some part of 1the house. This room will serve every mental purpose which we have covered in our preliminary studies- studio, dark chamber and\ndeveloping room.\n\nWe remember that if such a room is not available, then our work can be carried on at night in bed just as effectively.\r\n\t\tWe recall the fact that this action of the will requires as little strenuous effort as does the photographer in placing his object in a position where he can photograph it to the best advantage. \n\nIn fact, if the object is truly desired, then it is '' uppermost '' in our minds and in that position soon makes its presence felt in our consciousness without any effort on our part.\r\n\tPOURING LIGHT UPON OUR THOUGHT-OBJECT\r\n\t\tMoved by the gentle heat generated by our thinking, our mechanical faculties, the mechanical apparatus of the mind, which we have termed our mental camera, imperceptibly glides into action, and in this same instant, sitting in our darkened room, we behold the objects not outwardly but inwardly.\r\n\t\tSEEING OUR THOUGHT-OBJECT IN REFLECTION\r\n\t\t\tWe are seeing our objects now, not directly, but by means of the single inner mental eye of the mind's camera which has caught up, collected and transmitted the rays of our illumined thinking into the illumining chamber of our consciousness. We behold our objects there and study them by means of reflection.\r\n\t\tPOURING MORE MENTAL-LIGHT UPON OUR THOUGHT\r\n\t\t\tThen too, we must be familiar, by means of outward observation and experience, with the things which relate themselves to our inner picture.\n\nIf our thought of five thousand dollars is a vague one, then before we try to see it clearly in mind, we must go to the bank and ask the teller to show us five one-thousand bills, or fifty one-hundred bills, which we study carefully, and in this way, we get '' more light '' upon the money; we are able to see it mentally more clearly. \n\nSo with the business enterprise. If it is an automobile business we have in mind, we visit automobile factories and observe the method of building an automobile.\n\nSo with the home. We visit the homes of our friends, we become acquainted with the various kinds of architecture, the kinds of brick and timber, the arrangement of rooms and every other detail which will help to '' throw light '' upon the thought of the home which we are contemplating now.\r\n\t\t\tHowever, there is a yet finer, rarer light of understanding which we will now apply; an '' enlightenment '' which will make our reflected thought of money, business and home ever so much more clear for impressive purposes, and which will bring us ever so much more positive results.\r\n\t\t\t\tWe stimulate this finer light of understanding when in our contemplation we ask ourselves, '' Why do I want the five thousand dollars, the business, the home '', and when we answer this question from the inner spiritual source of all-light of our being, we bring a flood of illumination upon our projected thought.\r\n\t\t\t\tWe now begin to see our thought about the money, the business, the home in an \"entirely different light,'' as we say. \n\nWe see now that it is not the thing which we want but rather that which the thing symbolizes. It is not the outer object but the inner object which we are in the process of bringing forth.\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat is this inner object or purpose? It is not the money but the power which money symbolizes; it is not the business but the means it provides us for extending our good will to others, and for providing happiness to those whom we love; it is not the home, the building of brick or timber, but the comfort, the peace, the love, the joy, the domestic felicity, the shelter and protection which a home represents or should represent.\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe more we see our objects in this light of spiritual understanding, the more inspired we become, and this inspired thinking provides the radiant and luminous mental light where- by our object becomes crystal clear to us.\r\n\t\t\tESTABLISHING OUR CORRECT VIEWPOINT\r\n\t\t\t\tUnless of an unusually spiritually endowed or instructed mind, we would have viewed our purpose in securing five thousand dollars, or a business, or a home, as the average mind these things.

      "originalText": "How To Make Our Mental Pictures Come True (George Schubel)\r\n\tPREPARING OUR THOUGHT-OBJECT FOR REPRODUCTION\r\n\t\tWe have confidently selected a certain definite mental object which by means of this method of deliberate visualizing has become the object of our heart's desire.\r\n\t\tOur formulating faculties have been at work specializing and differentiating our desire, it has been placed in the current of our objective thinking, and now has taken shape as an object of thought in the photographic studio of our objective minds.\r\n\t\tSeating ourselves in a comfortable arm-chair which will permit the greatest possible relaxation, or reclining on a couch, or lying in bed, we begin our practical work by bringing the \"object of our heart's desire.\r\n\t\t\tOur first consideration is the quiet, darkened room in some part of 1the house. This room will serve every mental purpose which we have covered in our preliminary studies- studio, dark chamber and\ndeveloping room.\n\nWe remember that if such a room is not available, then our work can be carried on at night in bed just as effectively.\r\n\t\tWe recall the fact that this action of the will requires as little strenuous effort as does the photographer in placing his object in a position where he can photograph it to the best advantage. \n\nIn fact, if the object is truly desired, then it is '' uppermost '' in our minds and in that position soon makes its presence felt in our consciousness without any effort on our part.\r\n\tPOURING LIGHT UPON OUR THOUGHT-OBJECT\r\n\t\tMoved by the gentle heat generated by our thinking, our mechanical faculties, the mechanical apparatus of the mind, which we have termed our mental camera, imperceptibly glides into action, and in this same instant, sitting in our darkened room, we behold the objects not outwardly but inwardly.\r\n\t\tSEEING OUR THOUGHT-OBJECT IN REFLECTION\r\n\t\t\tWe are seeing our objects now, not directly, but by means of the single inner mental eye of the mind's camera which has caught up, collected and transmitted the rays of our illumined thinking into the illumining chamber of our consciousness. We behold our objects there and study them by means of reflection.\r\n\t\tPOURING MORE MENTAL-LIGHT UPON OUR THOUGHT\r\n\t\t\tThen too, we must be familiar, by means of outward observation and experience, with the things which relate themselves to our inner picture.\n\nIf our thought of five thousand dollars is a vague one, then before we try to see it clearly in mind, we must go to the bank and ask the teller to show us five one-thousand bills, or fifty one-hundred bills, which we study carefully, and in this way, we get '' more light '' upon the money; we are able to see it mentally more clearly. \n\nSo with the business enterprise. If it is an automobile business we have in mind, we visit automobile factories and observe the method of building an automobile.\n\nSo with the home. We visit the homes of our friends, we become acquainted with the various kinds of architecture, the kinds of brick and timber, the arrangement of rooms and every other detail which will help to '' throw light '' upon the thought of the home which we are contemplating now.\r\n\t\t\tHowever, there is a yet finer, rarer light of understanding which we will now apply; an '' enlightenment '' which will make our reflected thought of money, business and home ever so much more clear for impressive purposes, and which will bring us ever so much more positive results.\r\n\t\t\t\tWe stimulate this finer light of understanding when in our contemplation we ask ourselves, '' Why do I want the five thousand dollars, the business, the home '', and when we answer this question from the inner spiritual source of all-light of our being, we bring a flood of illumination upon our projected thought.\r\n\t\t\t\tWe now begin to see our thought about the money, the business, the home in an \"entirely different light,'' as we say. \n\nWe see now that it is not the thing which we want but rather that which the thing symbolizes. It is not the outer object but the inner object which we are in the process of bringing forth.\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat is this inner object or purpose? It is not the money but the power which money symbolizes; it is not the business but the means it provides us for extending our good will to others, and for providing happiness to those whom we love; it is not the home, the building of brick or timber, but the comfort, the peace, the love, the joy, the domestic felicity, the shelter and protection which a home represents or should represent.\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe more we see our objects in this light of spiritual understanding, the more inspired we become, and this inspired thinking provides the radiant and luminous mental light where- by our object becomes crystal clear to us.\r\n\t\t\tESTABLISHING OUR CORRECT VIEWPOINT\r\n\t\t\t\tUnless of an unusually spiritually endowed or instructed mind, we would have viewed our purpose in securing five thousand dollars, or a business, or a home, as the average mind these things. We would have viewed them simply as things.\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the manner that our money represents power, so, as we have already seen, our business represents service, and other mental values; and in like manner our home symbolizes comfort, shelter, love, protection, and those other qualities which we usually associate with the thought of home.\r\n\t\t\t\tIn a word, we now see these so-called things reflected in our minds not simply as things, but as the very underlying understanding of our being, formed and projected and ready to be brought forth into our outward lives; our understanding-light has shaped itself into the forms of money, business and home, and this understanding-light is made up of the prismatic qualities or causes which in this way become embodiments of power, service, good- will, protection, love, comfort, harmony, peace and joy in us and through us.\nTaking this viewpoint we need have no more concern with the impressiveness of our object and its power to reproduce itself.\r\n\tFOCUSING UPON OUR IMAGED THOUGHT\r\n\t\tWe have said that concentration upon one single object of thought does not mean necessarily that our thought must be comprised of only one thing; it may take in a number of things so long as they are directly related and serve to make a complete picture, and this is so in the instance of the career which we are outpicturing.\r\n\t\tWith proper light and a right viewpoint toward our thought, we focus our whole attention upon it, bearing in mind that we are now focusing not on the five thousand dollars, ' the business and the home, but upon the qualities of joy, love, protection, peace and happiness of which these mental objects are merely symbols.\r\n\t\tLet us also bear in mind that this concentration does not imply a tension or strained effort of the will, but rather an easy and pleasant exercise.\r\n\t\tWhat we aim to avoid now is the intrusion of any vagrant thoughts which may and will seek to enter within the magic circle where our one definite thought is held. \n\nWe must allow no fear thought, no opposing thought, no worry-thoughts, no alien thought of any kind to enter through our mental-camera eye, but rather must we keep our eye single to the one true thought of our career.\r\n\t\tIMPRESSING OUR IMAGED THOUGHT\r\n\t\t\tWe have seen that our money, our business, and our home is good for us to have, and in the moment in which we truly acknowledge and recognize this fact mentally, our thought will become an impressive one. \n\nIt will make its impression upon us in the finest and most definite way possible. \n\nThe shutter of the mind is voluntarily and momentarily lifted, the full light of our understanding moves into and impresses itself upon the sensitized film of our subjective thinking; it takes on the qualities of this subjective thinking and becomes en-filmed and sealed in the subjective; undergoing a silent, invisible inner development, or reduction on its way toward ultimate matter, and however infinitely inconceivable this reduction is, we can say that it is now becoming a more dense form than the pure form of mental light was before impression. \n\nWe are now ready to follow our imaged thought in the next stage of its outward development.\r\n\tOUR THOUGHT IMPRESSION IN SOLUTION\r\n\t\tResting in our passive or subjective attitude, a great calm comes over us at this moment; a great feeling of assurance and peace, and in most instances we fall into a restful, natural sleep. \n\nThat is as it should be. In the few moments in which the transference has occurred, the outer faculties have performed their function. The inner subjective and subconscious phase of mind is now at work and further formulation of our mental picture of the money, the business and the home, has begun.\r\n\t\tYour objective attitude of mind from this point on becomes, as we know, simply one of co-operation, and this co-operation is exemplified best when our thinking and acting in all our daily outward affairs is directed continually in ways which will facilitate the development of our thought.\r\n\t\t\tWe must have an understanding faith in the outcome of our developing picture; we must henceforth be true and loyal to the subjective forces working for us; we must be mentally alert to their direction; we must be patient; we must help by '' getting into the spirit '' of our picture; we must love it, as it were, into existence.\r\n\t\t\tBut separate from this we know that a movement of the underlying natural forces of this substance of our subconscious thinking or mind-solution now has been started in motion, carrying our projected understanding or thought with them, not only to the very depths of our own individualized subconsciousness but to all other minds which are for the moment subjectively conditioned to our thinking, until our thought is carried out and submerged into the very ocean of universal sub-sense-consciousness, attracting unto itself not only other thoughts but taking hold on the subsense side of all those things, circumstances, conditions and persons that are to be a part of its outward fulfillment.\r\n\tREVIEWING OUR DEVELOPING PICTURE FROM TIME TO TIME\r\n\t\tThe whole mental-mechanical and, to an extent, the mental-chemical process connected with the visualizing of our career, has\n perhaps taken from ten to thirty minutes of quiet contemplation and reflection in our '' silence room,'' depending upon the time which we have taken to get comfortably settled, and to concentrate upon our object.\r\n\t\tIn these moments, we mentally lift our enfilmed-thought of our career from its subjective bath, and quietly meditate upon it and review its progress subjectively, always remembering, however, that our examination of our mental picture is possible at any time and anywhere- at a railroad station, in a train, or while at work, and if we are true to our picture, we will find ourselves doing this, as we said before, without being consciously aware of the fact.\r\n\t\tWATCHING FOR OUTWARD INDICATIONS\r\n\t\t\tUnexpected persons, perhaps from a distance, having affinity or subjective kinship to our thought of money, business and home, now come to us in a seemingly miraculous manner. \n\nSeemingly trifling bits of information drift into our daily affairs, casual words are said, books are loaned to us, letters are received, and a hundred and one incidents of a like kind transpire, which manifest solely for the purpose of becoming a part of our forming picture.\r\n\tSTRENGTHENING OUR DEVELOPING THOUGHT\r\n\t\tSo with the business which we are developing mentally.

      "text": "Think and Grow Rich - The Legacy\n\tWhen you dig into Napoleon Hill's work what you are really digging into is who you are - Bob Proctor\n\tReprogramming  the Subconscious Mind for FAITH\n\t\tThe Subconscious Mind\n\t\t\tTHE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND consists of a field of consciousness, in which every impulse of thought that reaches the objective mind through any of the five senses, is classified and recorded, and from which thoughts may be recalled or withdrawn as letters may be taken from a filing cabinet.\n\t\t\tIt receives, and files, sense impressions or thoughts, regardless of their nature. You may VOLUNTARILY plant in your subconscious mind any plan, thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary equivalent. The subconscious acts first on the dominating desires which have been mixed with emotional feeling, such as faith.\n\t\t\tThe subconscious mind will not remain idle! If you fail to plant DESIRES in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the result of your neglect.\n\t\tThe seven major negative emotions (To be avoided)\n\t\t\tThe emotion of FEAR\n\t\t\t\tThe Six Basic Fears\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of POVERTY\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of CRITICISM\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of ILL HEALTH\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of LOSS OF LOVE OR SOMEONE\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of OLD AGE\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of DEATH\n\t\t\tThe emotion of JEALOUSY\n\t\t\tThe emotion of HATRED\n\t\t\tThe emotion of REVENGE\n\t\t\tThe emotion of GREED\n\t\t\tThe emotion of SUPERSTITION\n\t\t\tThe emotion of ANGER\n\t\tDevelop Faith\n\t\t\tRICHES begin in the form of THOUGHT!\n\nThe amount is limited only by the person in whose mind the THOUGHT is put into motion. \n\nFAITH removes limitations!\n\t\t\tFAITH is a state of mind which may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind, through the principle of auto-suggestion.\n\t\t\tYour BELIEF, or FAITH, is the element which determines the action of your subconscious mind.\n\t\t\tIf you fill your mind with FEAR, doubt and unbelief in your ability to connect with, and use the forces of Infinite Intelligence, the law of auto— suggestion will take this spirit of unbelief and use it as a pattern by which your subconscious mind will translate it into its physical equivalent.\n\t\tBob Proctor (Bonus Material)\n\t\t\tNo one is ready for a thing unless they believe they can acquire it. The state of mind must be belief and not mere hope or wish.\n\t\t\tOur belief systems are based on our evaluation of something and frequently if you evaluate a situation, your belief about that situation will change.\n\t\t\tThe idea that you should slow down when you are old is a false idea. All the energy, all the power is evenly present 100% in all places at the same time. Desire is the triggering mechanism\n\t\t\tWhen you read a good book a second time, you don't see something in it you didn't see before, you see something in yourself that wasn't there before.\n\t\t\t\"wants\" are of a conscious nature. The desire is the \"idea\" in your subconscious mind, seeking expression outside, through your action. You've got to believe it at a subconscious level. You can come to believe it through repetition.\n\t\t\tWe should always be going for bigger goals. We don't go for bigger goals to get, we go for bigger goals to grow. Our organization always wants to earn more money. Not to have the money, but what we can do with it. Money is an instrument we use to extend the good far beyond our physical presence.\n\tAcquire Specialized Knowledge\n\t\tKNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE END of accumulation of money. \n\t\tBefore you can be sure of your ability to transmute DESIRE into its monetary equivalent, you will require SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE of the service, merchandise, or profession which you intend to offer in return for fortune.\n\t\tThe accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is acquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized knowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the possession of the man who accumulates the fortune.\n\tCarry out your organized plans with FAITH and PERSISTENCE\n\t\t1. DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants is the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to surmount many difficulties.\n\t\t\tOnce you say \"Yes I am going to do that\" and you make that definite decision, the world starts to change because your mind, the greatest gift we have ever been given will start looking for ways to make your dream come true instead of looking for excuses. - Jim Stovall\n\t\t\tWhen I set a new goal, I have difficulty believing I can do it. You come to believe - Bob Proctor\n\t\t\tEveryone is still searching for that sense of power. The first and most powerful way to do that is by helping someone else - Nick Lowery\n\t\t2. DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire.\n\t\t\tEvery one of us has inside of us, it's innate, it's in our DNA, the desire to do something big - Tim Storey\n\t\t\tA burning desire is an inner flame that can never be extinguished. And if the cynics, doubters and negative talking people come, you will use their cynicism and doubt to propel you forward. - DR. Dennis Kimbro\n\t\t3. SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one's ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self- reliance can be developed through the principle described in the chapter on auto-suggestion).\n\t\t\tTo me being rich, means being in control. You are in control of your life. Being able to do the work that I want to do, the way that I want to do it, when I want to do it and to the level of excellence I want to do it at.  -  Darren Hardy\n\t\t\tIt's about having freedom. Freedom to choose where you want to be, who you want to be with. What you want to do for a living. How hard you want to work, who do you want to have in your life - Barbara Corcoran\n\t\t\tRich is not just synonymous with money. Rich is synonymous with living. Life is about expression of spirit. How can I be more artfully expressing who I am, fully. In a joyous way and accepting life as it comes to me without precondition.  Blaine Bartlett\n\t\t\tIf I want to be free, I got to be me - Sandra Gallagher\n\t\t\tWe succeeded with what we already had - Steve Wozniak\n\t\t\tYou were born an original, don't die a copy - Tim Storey\n\t\t4. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence.\n\t\t\tWhat you have to do is set daily standards and live by those standards one day at a time - Derek R. Mills\n\t\t\tFoster your strengths and whatever your weaknesses are, surround yourself with those types of people. -  John C. Shin\n\t\t\tPeople complicate things and put barriers and struggles in front of them that should not really exist - John Lee Dumas\n\t\t\tEach and everyone of us are where we are today because of the choices we've made before today - Sharon Lechter\n\t\t5. ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one's plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; \"guessing\" instead of \"knowing\" destroys persistence.\n\t\t\tMost people look at what success can give them and that is what they obsess over. Rather than obsessing what it will actually take to get to success. - Rob Dyrdek\n\t\t\tProbably the biggest obstacle that any individual has to overcome is mindset - DR. Dennis Kimbro\n\t\t\tYou're always potentially three feet from gold - Darren Hardey\n\t\t6. CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence.\n\t\t\tYou can always hire the attributes in the next that you don't have yourself and build an empire on their know- how -- Barbara Corcoran\n\t\t\tIf you want to inspire people, follow your dreams. Whether you actually achieve them or not, is irrelevant. It is the pursuit of going after what you were born to do, is what inspires other people - Lewis Howes\n\t\t7. WILL-POWER. The habit of concentrating one's thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose, leads to persistence.\n\t\t\tMost people do not have patience. That's because they don't have faith. We're in a culture where we want things right now. We have to be careful because this will destroy you. You end up dabbling, giving up and missing out on so many amazing things that life has to offer- Joel Brown\n\t\t\tSuccessful people have an inability to feel sorry for themselves when they get hit. They feel the pain like everyone else but they are very good at getting back up fast without feeling sorry for themselves -Barbara Corcoran\n\t\t\tThe best advice I would give is... If you want to be, do! Just put in those 10,000 hours - John Lee Dumas\n\t\t\tIf your goals and desires are stronger than the adversity that you are going to face, it will pull you through  - Errol Abramson\n\t\t8. HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by forced repetition of acts of courage.

      "originalText": "Think and Grow Rich - The Legacy\n\tWhen you dig into Napoleon Hill's work what you are really digging into is who you are - Bob Proctor\n\tReprogramming  the Subconscious Mind for FAITH\n\t\tThe Subconscious Mind\n\t\t\tTHE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND consists of a field of consciousness, in which every impulse of thought that reaches the objective mind through any of the five senses, is classified and recorded, and from which thoughts may be recalled or withdrawn as letters may be taken from a filing cabinet.\n\t\t\tIt receives, and files, sense impressions or thoughts, regardless of their nature. You may VOLUNTARILY plant in your subconscious mind any plan, thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary equivalent. The subconscious acts first on the dominating desires which have been mixed with emotional feeling, such as faith.\n\t\t\tThe subconscious mind will not remain idle! If you fail to plant DESIRES in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the result of your neglect.\n\t\tThe seven major negative emotions (To be avoided)\n\t\t\tThe emotion of FEAR\n\t\t\t\tThe Six Basic Fears\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of POVERTY\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of CRITICISM\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of ILL HEALTH\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of LOSS OF LOVE OR SOMEONE\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of OLD AGE\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fear of DEATH\n\t\t\tThe emotion of JEALOUSY\n\t\t\tThe emotion of HATRED\n\t\t\tThe emotion of REVENGE\n\t\t\tThe emotion of GREED\n\t\t\tThe emotion of SUPERSTITION\n\t\t\tThe emotion of ANGER\n\t\tDevelop Faith\n\t\t\tRICHES begin in the form of THOUGHT!\n\nThe amount is limited only by the person in whose mind the THOUGHT is put into motion. \n\nFAITH removes limitations!\n\t\t\tFAITH is a state of mind which may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind, through the principle of auto-suggestion.\n\t\t\tYour BELIEF, or FAITH, is the element which determines the action of your subconscious mind.\n\t\t\tIf you fill your mind with FEAR, doubt and unbelief in your ability to connect with, and use the forces of Infinite Intelligence, the law of auto— suggestion will take this spirit of unbelief and use it as a pattern by which your subconscious mind will translate it into its physical equivalent.\n\t\tBob Proctor (Bonus Material)\n\t\t\tNo one is ready for a thing unless they believe they can acquire it. The state of mind must be belief and not mere hope or wish.\n\t\t\tOur belief systems are based on our evaluation of something and frequently if you evaluate a situation, your belief about that situation will change.\n\t\t\tThe idea that you should slow down when you are old is a false idea. All the energy, all the power is evenly present 100% in all places at the same time. Desire is the triggering mechanism\n\t\t\tWhen you read a good book a second time, you don't see something in it you didn't see before, you see something in yourself that wasn't there before.\n\t\t\t\"wants\" are of a conscious nature. The desire is the \"idea\" in your subconscious mind, seeking expression outside, through your action. You've got to believe it at a subconscious level. You can come to believe it through repetition.\n\t\t\tWe should always be going for bigger goals. We don't go for bigger goals to get, we go for bigger goals to grow. Our organization always wants to earn more money. Not to have the money, but what we can do with it. Money is an instrument we use to extend the good far beyond our physical presence.\n\tAcquire Specialized Knowledge\n\t\tKNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE END of accumulation of money. \n\t\tBefore you can be sure of your ability to transmute DESIRE into its monetary equivalent, you will require SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE of the service, merchandise, or profession which you intend to offer in return for fortune.\n\t\tThe accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is acquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized knowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the possession of the man who accumulates the fortune.\n\tCarry out your organized plans with FAITH and PERSISTENCE\n\t\t1. DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants is the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to surmount many difficulties.\n\t\t\tOnce you say \"Yes I am going to do that\" and you make that definite decision, the world starts to change because your mind, the greatest gift we have ever been given will start looking for ways to make your dream come true instead of looking for excuses. - Jim Stovall\n\t\t\tWhen I set a new goal, I have difficulty believing I can do it. You come to believe - Bob Proctor\n\t\t\tEveryone is still searching for that sense of power. The first and most powerful way to do that is by helping someone else - Nick Lowery\n\t\t2. DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire.\n\t\t\tEvery one of us has inside of us, it's innate, it's in our DNA, the desire to do something big - Tim Storey\n\t\t\tA burning desire is an inner flame that can never be extinguished. And if the cynics, doubters and negative talking people come, you will use their cynicism and doubt to propel you forward. - DR. Dennis Kimbro\n\t\t3. SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one's ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self- reliance can be developed through the principle described in the chapter on auto-suggestion).\n\t\t\tTo me being rich, means being in control. You are in control of your life. Being able to do the work that I want to do, the way that I want to do it, when I want to do it and to the level of excellence I want to do it at.  -  Darren Hardy\n\t\t\tIt's about having freedom. Freedom to choose where you want to be, who you want to be with. What you want to do for a living. How hard you want to work, who do you want to have in your life - Barbara Corcoran\n\t\t\tRich is not just synonymous with money. Rich is synonymous with living. Life is about expression of spirit. How can I be more artfully expressing who I am, fully. In a joyous way and accepting life as it comes to me without precondition.  Blaine Bartlett\n\t\t\tIf I want to be free, I got to be me - Sandra Gallagher\n\t\t\tWe succeeded with what we already had - Steve Wozniak\n\t\t\tYou were born an original, don't die a copy - Tim Storey\n\t\t4. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence.\n\t\t\tWhat you have to do is set daily standards and live by those standards one day at a time - Derek R. Mills\n\t\t\tFoster your strengths and whatever your weaknesses are, surround yourself with those types of people. -  John C. Shin\n\t\t\tPeople complicate things and put barriers and struggles in front of them that should not really exist - John Lee Dumas\n\t\t\tEach and everyone of us are where we are today because of the choices we've made before today - Sharon Lechter\n\t\t5. ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one's plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; \"guessing\" instead of \"knowing\" destroys persistence.\n\t\t\tMost people look at what success can give them and that is what they obsess over. Rather than obsessing what it will actually take to get to success. - Rob Dyrdek\n\t\t\tProbably the biggest obstacle that any individual has to overcome is mindset - DR. Dennis Kimbro\n\t\t\tYou're always potentially three feet from gold - Darren Hardey\n\t\t6. CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence.\n\t\t\tYou can always hire the attributes in the next that you don't have yourself and build an empire on their know- how -- Barbara Corcoran\n\t\t\tIf you want to inspire people, follow your dreams. Whether you actually achieve them or not, is irrelevant. It is the pursuit of going after what you were born to do, is what inspires other people - Lewis Howes\n\t\t7. WILL-POWER. The habit of concentrating one's thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose, leads to persistence.\n\t\t\tMost people do not have patience. That's because they don't have faith. We're in a culture where we want things right now. We have to be careful because this will destroy you. You end up dabbling, giving up and missing out on so many amazing things that life has to offer- Joel Brown\n\t\t\tSuccessful people have an inability to feel sorry for themselves when they get hit. They feel the pain like everyone else but they are very good at getting back up fast without feeling sorry for themselves -Barbara Corcoran\n\t\t\tThe best advice I would give is... If you want to be, do! Just put in those 10,000 hours - John Lee Dumas\n\t\t\tIf your goals and desires are stronger than the adversity that you are going to face, it will pull you through  - Errol Abramson\n\t\t8. HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by forced repetition of acts of courage. Everyone who has seen active service in war knows this.\n\t\t\tThe mentality that makes the difference is action  - Grant Cardone\n\t\t\tThe easiest way to change your life is to say \"Thank You\" or think \"Thank You\" before you go to bed and and when you wake up.- Dave Meltzer\n\t\t\tYou can not change any thing in your life unless you change the way you think about life. Any change requires action and any action requires thinking - DR. J.B.HILL\n\t\tDarren Hardy (Bonus Material)\n\t\t\tI chose from that point onward that I'd always choose character over success. The odd thing about that is if you live that way, success finds you.\n\t\t\tI think that \"obsession\" is what people need to find success\n\t\t\tOf all the extraordinary achievers I've gotten to know, study and publish stories in success magazine, the one commonality amongst all of them is that are constantly learning. growing and looking for the edge to improve themselves.\n\t\t\tConsistency - It's how long you last and very few last.\n\t\tLewis Howes (Bonus Material)\n\t\t\twhen I shifted my inner world, my outer world opened up to me, for incredible possibilities\n\t\t\teven if the worst thing possible happens to you, there is still a way to find your inner freedom and make the most of that experience\n\t\t\tI was unapologetic in promoting my dreams and going after what I wanted\n\t\t\"If we are related,\" said the immortal Emerson, \"we shall meet.\" In closing, may I borrow his thought, and say, \"If we are related, we have, through these pages, met.\" - Napoleon HIll"

The only way by which we may secure possession of power is to become conscious of power, and we can never become conscious of power until we learn that all power is from within.\r\n\t\tThere is a world within – a world of thought and feeling and power; of light and life and beauty and, although invisible, its forces are mighty.\n\nThe world within is governed by mind. When we discover this world we shall find the solution for every problem, the cause for every effect; and, since the world within is subject to our control, all laws of power and possession are also within our control.\n\nThe world without is a reflection of the world within. What appears without is what has been found within. In the world within may be found infinite Wisdom, infinite Power, and an infinite Supply of all that is necessary, waiting for unfoldment, development and expression. If we recognize these potentialities in the world within, they will take form in the world without.\r\n\t\t Harmony in the world within will be reflected in the world without by harmonious conditions, agreeable surroundings, the best of everything.

      "originalText": "The Universe is Mental\nParamahansa Yogananda, Neville Goddard, \nJoseph Murphy, Charles F. Haanel\r\n\tCharles F. Haanel\r\n\t\tWe cannot express powers that we do not possess. The only way by which we may secure possession of power is to become conscious of power, and we can never become conscious of power until we learn that all power is from within.\r\n\t\tThere is a world within – a world of thought and feeling and power; of light and life and beauty and, although invisible, its forces are mighty.\n\nThe world within is governed by mind. When we discover this world we shall find the solution for every problem, the cause for every effect; and, since the world within is subject to our control, all laws of power and possession are also within our control.\n\nThe world without is a reflection of the world within. What appears without is what has been found within. In the world within may be found infinite Wisdom, infinite Power, and an infinite Supply of all that is necessary, waiting for unfoldment, development and expression. If we recognize these potentialities in the world within, they will take form in the world without.\r\n\t\t Harmony in the world within will be reflected in the world without by harmonious conditions, agreeable surroundings, the best of everything. It is the foundation of health and a necessary essential to all greatness, all power, all attainment, all achievement and all success.\r\n\t\tAs we become conscious of the wisdom in the world within, we mentally take possession of this wisdom, and by taking mental possession we come into actual possession of the power and wisdom necessary to bring into manifestation the essentials necessary for our most complete and harmonious development.\n\r\n\tJoseph Murphy\r\n\t\tAll of us have our own inner fears, beliefs, opinions.

Rise to the upper chambers of your mental dwelling, and key yourself up to a strong pitch, away above the vibrations on the lower planes of thought. \n\nThen you will not only be immune to their negative vibrations but will be in touch with the great body of strong positive thought coming from those of your own plane of development.\r\n\t\tDo not understand me as advocating a high tension continuously. This is not at all desirable, not only because it is apt to be too much of a strain upon you but also because you will find it desirable to relieve the tension at times and become receptive that you may absorb impressions. \n\nIt is well to be able to relax and assume a certain degree of receptiveness, knowing that you are always able to spring back to the more positive state at will.\r\n\tReceiving Divine Will \r\n\t\tThe amenability of the mind to the will can be increased by properly directed practice. That which we are in the habit of referring to as the “strengthening of the Will” is in reality the training of the mind to recognize and absorb the Power Within. \n\nThe Will is strong enough, it does not need strengthening, but the mind needs to be trained to receive and act upon the suggestions of the Will. \n\nThe Will is the outward manifestation of the I AM.\r\n\t\tEvery man has, potentially, a strong Will, and that all he has to do is to train his mind to make use of it. I think that in the higher regions of the mind of every man is a great store of Will Power awaiting his use.\r\n\t\t\nHe who has developed his mind so that it will allow the Will Power to manifest through it, has opened up wonderful possibilities for himself. \n\nNot only has he found a great power at his command, but he is able to bring into play, and use, faculties, talents and abilities of whose existence he has not dreamed. \n\nThis secret of the Will is the magic key which opens all doors.\r\n\tAligning with The Higher Self\r\n\t\tHe who understands the laws of his mental being, develops his latent powers and uses them intelligently. \n\nHe does not despise his Passive mental functions, but makes good use of them also, charges them with the duties for which they are best fitted, and is able to obtain wonderful results from their work, having mastered them and trained them to do the bidding of the Higher Self.\r\n\t\tHe knows that the real man within him is the master to whom both Active and Passive functions are but tools.

When you are tempted to burst into Anger - assert the “I,” and your voice will drop. \n\nWhen you feel vexed and cross, remember what you are, and rise above your feeling. When you feel Fearful, remember that the Real Self fears nothing, and assert Courage. \n\nWhen you feel Jealousy inciting, think of your higher nature, and laugh.

Thoughts held in mind at this level are very powerful and tend to manifest rapidly. \n\nThe phenomenon of synchronicity is continuous.\nThe mechanisms of cause and effect and the inner working of the universe stand forth clearly revealed,\nas we are now witnessing the very basis of Reality itself.\n\nThese very high states of awareness happen spontaneously and unexpectedly,\nand they tend to recur and stay for longer and longer durations.\nOnce this has been experienced, our intention automatically becomes to make the state of peace permanent."

Hawkins)\r\n                        Energy Level 500: Love\r\n                                Love as depicted in the mass media is not what this level is about. What the world generally refers to as love is an intense emotional condition, combining physical attraction, possessiveness, control, addiction, eroticism, and novelty. It’s usually fragile and fluctuating, waxing and waning with varying conditions. When frustrated, this emotion often reveals an underlying anger and dependency that it had masked. \r\n                                The 500 level is characterized by the development of a Love that is unconditional, unchanging, and permanent. It doesn’t fluctuate—its source isn’t dependent on external factors. Loving is a state of being. It’s a forgiving, nurturing, and supportive way of relating to the world.\r\n                                This is the level of true happiness, but although the world is fascinated with the subject of Love, and all viable religions calibrate at 500 or over, it’s interesting to note that only 0.4 percent of the world’s population ever reaches this level of evolution of consciousness.\r\n                        Energy Level 540: Joy\r\n                                As Love becomes more and more unconditional, it begins to be experienced as inner Joy. This isn’t the sudden joy of a pleasurable turn of events; it’s a constant accompaniment to all activities. Joy arises from within each moment of existence, rather than from any other source; 540 is also the level of healing and of spiritually based self- help groups.\r\n                                From level 540 up is the domain of saints, and advanced spiritual students and healers. A capacity for enormous patience and the persistence of a positive attitude in the face of prolonged adversity is characteristic of this energy field; the hallmark of this state is compassion.\r\n                        Energy Level 600: Peace\r\n                                This energy field is associated with the experience designated by such terms as transcendence, self-realization, and God-consciousness.\r\n                                It’s extremely rare, attained by only 1 in 10 million people. When this state is reached, the distinction between subject and object disappears, and there’s no specific focal point of perception. Not uncommonly, individuals at this level remove themselves from the world, as the state of bliss that ensues precludes ordinary activity. Some become spiritual teachers; others work anonymously for the betterment of mankind. A few become great geniuses in their respective fields and make major contributions to society. These people are saintly and may eventually be officially designated as such, although at this level, formal religion is commonly transcended, to be replaced by the pure spirituality out of which all religion originates.\r\n                Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.\r\n                Emotional Guidance Scale (Ask and It Is Given' by Jerry and Esther Hicks)",

Joy arises from within each moment of existence, rather than from any other source; 540 is also the level of healing and of spiritually based self- help groups.\r\n                                From level 540 up is the domain of saints, and advanced spiritual students and healers. A capacity for enormous patience and the persistence of a positive attitude in the face of prolonged adversity is characteristic of this energy field; the hallmark of this state is compassion.\r\n                        Energy Level 600: Peace\r\n                                This energy field is associated with the experience designated by such terms as transcendence, self-realization, and God-consciousness.\r\n                                It’s extremely rare, attained by only 1 in 10 million people. When this state is reached, the distinction between subject and object disappears, and there’s no specific focal point of perception. Not uncommonly, individuals at this level remove themselves from the world, as the state of bliss that ensues precludes ordinary activity. Some become spiritual teachers; others work anonymously for the betterment of mankind. A few become great geniuses in their respective fields and make major contributions to society. These people are saintly and may eventually be officially designated as such, although at this level, formal religion is commonly transcended, to be replaced by the pure spirituality out of which all religion originates.\r\n                Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.\r\n                Emotional Guidance Scale (Ask and It Is Given' by Jerry and Esther Hicks)"

See that you give them a use value greater than the cash value \nyou are taking from them. \n                        The mind that seeks for mastery over others is the competitive mind; and the competitive \nmind is not the creative one.\n                Quotes on \n\"Getting into the Right Business\"\n                        You will get rich most easily in point of effort, if you do that for which you are best \nfitted; but you will get rich most satisfactorily if you do that which you WANT to do. \n                        You are not obliged to do what you do not like to do, and should not do it except as a \nmeans to bring you to the doing of the thing you want to do. \n                        Do not be afraid to make a sudden and radical change if the opportunity is presented, and \nyou feel after careful consideration that it is the right opportunity; but never take sudden \nor radical action when you are in doubt as to the wisdom of doing so."

Why these certain graphemes are linked to those certain phonemes and this certain assemblage points towards that certain concept or object? Because we have arbitrarily, willing consciously, but mostly not, chosen so. However, it is the long-term consistency (sometimes for millennia within the same frame of entanglement of words, things, and thoughts) which allows our extended communities to develop the making of fire into the generation of machines.\n\nSlow, but Constant\nThe speed of light is the fastest a particle-wave could possibly move. It might very well be an absolute limit.

Why these certain graphemes are linked to those certain phonemes and this certain assemblage points towards that certain concept or object?

      "text": "The Kybalion\r\nThe Three Initiates (2022 Interpretation)\r\n\tPremise\r\n\t\t  \"Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted, from state to state; degree to degree; condition to condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration. True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art.\" \r\n\r\n-The Kybalion.\r\n\tThe Principle of Mentalism\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that \"All is Mind.\"\r\n\r\nIt explains that THE ALL (which is the Substantial Reality underlying all the outward manifestations and appearances which we know under the terms of \"The Material Universe\"; the \"Phenomena of Life\"; \"Matter\"; \"Energy\"; and, in short, all that is apparent to our material senses) is SPIRIT which in itself is UNKNOWABLE and UNDEFINABLE, but which may be considered and thought of as AN UNIVERSAL, INFINITE, LIVING MIND. \r\n\r\nIt also explains that all the phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a whole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the Mind of THE ALL, in which Mind we \"live and move and have our being.\" \r\n\r\nThis Principle, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily explains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such a large portion of the public attention, and which, without such explanation, are non-understandable and defy scientific treatment. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of this great Hermetic Principle of Mentalism enables the individual to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to apply the same to his well-being and advancement. \r\n\t\t\tDo not make the mistake of supposing that the little world you see around you--the Earth, which is a mere grain of dust in the Universe--is the Universe itself. \r\n\r\nThere are millions upon millions of such worlds, and greater. And there are millions of millions of such Universes in existence within the Infinite Mind of THE ALL. \r\n\r\nThere are beings with powers and attributes higher than Man has ever dreamed of the gods' possessing. \r\n\r\nAnd yet these beings were once as you, and still lower--and you will be even as they, and still higher, in time, for such is the Destiny of Man as reported by the Illumined.\r\n\t\t\tSo, do not feel insecure or afraid--we are all HELD FIRMLY IN THE INFINITE MIND OF THE ALL, and there is naught to hurt us or for us to fear. \r\n\r\nThere is no Power outside of THE ALL to affect us. So we may rest calm and secure.\r\n\tThe Principle of Correspondence\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that there is always a Correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life. \r\n\r\nThe old Hermetic axiom ran in these words: \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\" And the grasping of this Principle gives one the means of solving many a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. \r\n\r\nThere are planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of Correspondence to them we are able to understand much that would otherwise be unknowable to us. \r\n\r\nThis Principle is of universal application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material, mental, and spiritual universe--it is an Universal Law. \r\n\r\nThe ancient Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid from view the Unknown.\r\n\t\t\tThe Great Physical Plane.\r\n\t\t\tThe Great Mental Plane.\r\n\t\t\tThe Great Spiritual Plane.\r\n\t\t\t\tOn the Seven Minor Planes of the Great Spiritual Plane exist Beings of whom we may speak as Angels; Archangels; Demi-Gods. \r\n\r\nOn the lower Minor Planes dwell those great souls whom we call Masters and Adepts. \r\n\r\nAbove them come the Great Hierarchies of the Angelic Hosts, unthinkable to man; and above those come those who may without irreverence be called \"The Gods,\" so high in the scale of Being are they, their being, intelligence and power being akin to those attributed by the races of men to their conceptions of Deity. \r\n\r\nThese Beings are beyond even the highest flights of the human imagination, the word \"Divine\" being the only one applicable to them. \r\n\r\nMany of these Beings, as well as the Angelic Host, take the greatest interest in the affairs of the Universe and play an important part in its affairs. \r\n\r\nThese Unseen Divinities and Angelic Helpers extend their influence freely and powerfully, in the process of Evolution, and Cosmic Progress. \r\n\r\nTheir occasional intervention and assistance in human affairs have led to the many legends, beliefs, religions and traditions of the race, past and present. \r\n\r\nThey have superimposed their knowledge and power upon the world, again and again, all under the Law of THE ALL, of course.\r\n\tThe Principle of Vibration\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is in motion\"; \"everything vibrates\"; \"nothing is at rest\"; facts which Modern Science endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify. \r\n\r\nAnd yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of Ancient Egypt. \r\n\r\nThis Principle explains that the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. \r\n\r\nFrom THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration--the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale. \r\n\r\nThe vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly moving wheel seems to be motionless. \r\n\r\nAnd at the other end of the scale, there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem at rest. \r\n\r\nBetween these poles, there are millions upon millions of varying degrees of vibration. \r\n\r\nFrom corpuscle and electron, atom and molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion. \r\n\r\nThis is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose states depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas, enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways.\r\n\t\t\tManifestation of thought, emotion, reason, will or desire, or any mental state or condition, are accompanied by vibrations, a portion of which are thrown off and which tend to affect the minds of other persons by \"induction.\" \r\n\r\nThis is the principle which produces the phenomena of \"telepathy\"; mental influence, and other forms of the action and power of mind over mind.\r\n\tThe Principle of Polarity\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is dual\"; \"everything has two poles\"; \"everything has its pair of opposites,\" all of which were old Hermetic axioms. \r\n\r\nIt explains the old paradoxes, that have perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: \"Thesis and antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; \"opposites are the same, differing only in degree\"; \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled\"; \"extremes meet\"; \"everything is and isn't, at the same time\"; \"all truths are but half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\"; \"there are two sides to everything,\" etc., etc., etc. \r\n\r\nIt explains that in everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that \"opposites\" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with many varying degrees between them. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Heat and Cold, although \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. \r\n\r\nLook at your thermometer and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins! \r\n\r\nThe two terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\" is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. \r\n\r\nSo \"heat\" and \"cold\" are simply the \"two poles\" of that which we call \"Heat\"--and the phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of Polarity. \r\n\r\nThe same Principle manifests in the case of \"Light and Darkness,\" which are the same thing, the difference consisting of varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does \"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between \"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"? Between \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and Low\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes.\r\n\r\nIn short, the \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master the art.\r\n\t\t\tWe have shown you that a mental state and its opposite were merely the two poles of one thing, and that by Mental Transmutation the polarity might be reversed.\r\n\r\nThis Principle is known to modern psychologists, who apply it to the breaking up of undesirable habits by bidding their students concentrate upon the opposite quality. If you are possessed of Fear, do not waste time trying to \"kill out\" Fear, but instead cultivate the quality of Courage, and the Fear will disappear.\r\n\tThe Principle of Rhythm\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that in everything there is manifested a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and low-tide; between the two poles which exist in accordance with the Principle of Polarity described a moment ago. \r\n\r\nThere is always an action and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind, energy, and matter. T\r\n\r\nhis law is manifest in the creation and destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the life of all things; and finally in the mental states of Man (and it is with this latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most important). \r\n\r\nThe Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its universal application, and have also discovered certain means to overcome its effects in themselves by the use of the appropriate formulas and methods. They apply the Mental Law of Neutralization. \r\n\r\nThey cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they have learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain degree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle. \r\n\r\nThey have learned how to USE it, instead of being USED BY it.

      "originalText": "The Kybalion\r\nThe Three Initiates (2022 Interpretation)\r\n\tPremise\r\n\t\t  \"Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted, from state to state; degree to degree; condition to condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration. True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art.\" \r\n\r\n-The Kybalion.\r\n\tThe Principle of Mentalism\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that \"All is Mind.\"\r\n\r\nIt explains that THE ALL (which is the Substantial Reality underlying all the outward manifestations and appearances which we know under the terms of \"The Material Universe\"; the \"Phenomena of Life\"; \"Matter\"; \"Energy\"; and, in short, all that is apparent to our material senses) is SPIRIT which in itself is UNKNOWABLE and UNDEFINABLE, but which may be considered and thought of as AN UNIVERSAL, INFINITE, LIVING MIND. \r\n\r\nIt also explains that all the phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a whole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the Mind of THE ALL, in which Mind we \"live and move and have our being.\" \r\n\r\nThis Principle, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily explains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such a large portion of the public attention, and which, without such explanation, are non-understandable and defy scientific treatment. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of this great Hermetic Principle of Mentalism enables the individual to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to apply the same to his well-being and advancement. \r\n\t\t\tDo not make the mistake of supposing that the little world you see around you--the Earth, which is a mere grain of dust in the Universe--is the Universe itself. \r\n\r\nThere are millions upon millions of such worlds, and greater. And there are millions of millions of such Universes in existence within the Infinite Mind of THE ALL. \r\n\r\nThere are beings with powers and attributes higher than Man has ever dreamed of the gods' possessing. \r\n\r\nAnd yet these beings were once as you, and still lower--and you will be even as they, and still higher, in time, for such is the Destiny of Man as reported by the Illumined.\r\n\t\t\tSo, do not feel insecure or afraid--we are all HELD FIRMLY IN THE INFINITE MIND OF THE ALL, and there is naught to hurt us or for us to fear. \r\n\r\nThere is no Power outside of THE ALL to affect us. So we may rest calm and secure.\r\n\tThe Principle of Correspondence\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that there is always a Correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life. \r\n\r\nThe old Hermetic axiom ran in these words: \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\" And the grasping of this Principle gives one the means of solving many a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. \r\n\r\nThere are planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of Correspondence to them we are able to understand much that would otherwise be unknowable to us. \r\n\r\nThis Principle is of universal application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material, mental, and spiritual universe--it is an Universal Law. \r\n\r\nThe ancient Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid from view the Unknown.\r\n\t\t\tThe Great Physical Plane.\r\n\t\t\tThe Great Mental Plane.\r\n\t\t\tThe Great Spiritual Plane.\r\n\t\t\t\tOn the Seven Minor Planes of the Great Spiritual Plane exist Beings of whom we may speak as Angels; Archangels; Demi-Gods. \r\n\r\nOn the lower Minor Planes dwell those great souls whom we call Masters and Adepts. \r\n\r\nAbove them come the Great Hierarchies of the Angelic Hosts, unthinkable to man; and above those come those who may without irreverence be called \"The Gods,\" so high in the scale of Being are they, their being, intelligence and power being akin to those attributed by the races of men to their conceptions of Deity. \r\n\r\nThese Beings are beyond even the highest flights of the human imagination, the word \"Divine\" being the only one applicable to them. \r\n\r\nMany of these Beings, as well as the Angelic Host, take the greatest interest in the affairs of the Universe and play an important part in its affairs. \r\n\r\nThese Unseen Divinities and Angelic Helpers extend their influence freely and powerfully, in the process of Evolution, and Cosmic Progress. \r\n\r\nTheir occasional intervention and assistance in human affairs have led to the many legends, beliefs, religions and traditions of the race, past and present. \r\n\r\nThey have superimposed their knowledge and power upon the world, again and again, all under the Law of THE ALL, of course.\r\n\tThe Principle of Vibration\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is in motion\"; \"everything vibrates\"; \"nothing is at rest\"; facts which Modern Science endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify. \r\n\r\nAnd yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of Ancient Egypt. \r\n\r\nThis Principle explains that the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. \r\n\r\nFrom THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration--the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale. \r\n\r\nThe vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly moving wheel seems to be motionless. \r\n\r\nAnd at the other end of the scale, there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem at rest. \r\n\r\nBetween these poles, there are millions upon millions of varying degrees of vibration. \r\n\r\nFrom corpuscle and electron, atom and molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion. \r\n\r\nThis is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose states depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas, enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways.\r\n\t\t\tManifestation of thought, emotion, reason, will or desire, or any mental state or condition, are accompanied by vibrations, a portion of which are thrown off and which tend to affect the minds of other persons by \"induction.\" \r\n\r\nThis is the principle which produces the phenomena of \"telepathy\"; mental influence, and other forms of the action and power of mind over mind.\r\n\tThe Principle of Polarity\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is dual\"; \"everything has two poles\"; \"everything has its pair of opposites,\" all of which were old Hermetic axioms. \r\n\r\nIt explains the old paradoxes, that have perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: \"Thesis and antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; \"opposites are the same, differing only in degree\"; \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled\"; \"extremes meet\"; \"everything is and isn't, at the same time\"; \"all truths are but half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\"; \"there are two sides to everything,\" etc., etc., etc. \r\n\r\nIt explains that in everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that \"opposites\" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with many varying degrees between them. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Heat and Cold, although \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. \r\n\r\nLook at your thermometer and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins! \r\n\r\nThe two terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\" is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. \r\n\r\nSo \"heat\" and \"cold\" are simply the \"two poles\" of that which we call \"Heat\"--and the phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of Polarity. \r\n\r\nThe same Principle manifests in the case of \"Light and Darkness,\" which are the same thing, the difference consisting of varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does \"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between \"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"? Between \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and Low\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes.\r\n\r\nIn short, the \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master the art.\r\n\t\t\tWe have shown you that a mental state and its opposite were merely the two poles of one thing, and that by Mental Transmutation the polarity might be reversed.\r\n\r\nThis Principle is known to modern psychologists, who apply it to the breaking up of undesirable habits by bidding their students concentrate upon the opposite quality. If you are possessed of Fear, do not waste time trying to \"kill out\" Fear, but instead cultivate the quality of Courage, and the Fear will disappear.\r\n\tThe Principle of Rhythm\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that in everything there is manifested a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and low-tide; between the two poles which exist in accordance with the Principle of Polarity described a moment ago. \r\n\r\nThere is always an action and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind, energy, and matter. T\r\n\r\nhis law is manifest in the creation and destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the life of all things; and finally in the mental states of Man (and it is with this latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most important). \r\n\r\nThe Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its universal application, and have also discovered certain means to overcome its effects in themselves by the use of the appropriate formulas and methods. They apply the Mental Law of Neutralization. \r\n\r\nThey cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they have learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain degree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle. \r\n\r\nThey have learned how to USE it, instead of being USED BY it. In this and similar methods, consist the Art of the Hermetists. The Master of Hermetics polarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then neutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which would tend to carry him to the other pole. \r\n\r\nAll individuals who have attained any degree of Self-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously, but the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of belief on the part of the masses who are swung backward and forward like a pendulum. \r\n\r\nThis Principle and that of Polarity have been closely studied by the Hermetists, and the methods of counteracting, neutralizing, and USING them form an important part of the Hermetic Mental Alchemy.\r\n\tThe Principle of Cause & Effect\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the fact that there is a Cause for every Effect; an Effect from every Cause. It explains that: \"Everything Happens according to Law\"; that nothing ever \"merely happens\"; that there is no such thing as Chance; that while there are various planes of Cause and Effect, the higher dominating the lower planes, still nothing ever entirely escapes the Law. \r\n\r\nThe Hermetists understand the art and methods of rising above the ordinary plane of Cause and Effect, to a certain degree, and by mentally rising to a higher plane they become Causers instead of Effects. \r\n\r\nThe masses of people are carried along, obedient to environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than themselves; heredity; suggestion; and other outward causes moving them about like pawns on the Chessboard of Life.\r\n\tThe Principle of Gender\r\n\t\tThis Principle embodies the truth that there is GENDER manifested in everything--the Masculine and Feminine Principles ever at work. \r\n\r\nThis is true not only of the Physical Plane, but of the Mental and even the Spiritual Planes.
